    "content" : "business is always a much better margin business. And depending on the type of the product and\nthe age of the product, this can give anything between 20%-30% EBITDA levels.\n\nAmtoj Singh: Got it, sir. And my next question was on the propulsion system side of the business. I think\nearlier we had mentioned that we were focused on completely backward integrating traction\nmotors, considering we had a partnership with ABB around that. So how has that been ventured\nout?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: So we have given that also in our strategic plan. If you see the strategic plan and outlook speaks\nspecifically of the propulsion system as a separate SBU. And there we have also explained how\nthe propulsion system is going to be an SBU that will take care of our internal requirements, but\nalso going to be selling components to the Indian railways and to others. Traction motors, we\nare already selling substantial traction motors to the Indian railway. We have been doing that.\nThis quarter, we will start our first propulsion system supplies also for EMU menu. The TCMS\nis something that we have taken a complete transfer of technology from ABB, with whom we\nhave a TOT agreement. So in this manner, the component part, the cabinet cubicle, now we are\ncompletely 100% doing it already for our existing Metro. So all the items that we are doing as\nfar as the propulsion system, electrical and components. Over a period of the next couple of\nyears, we are intending to do introducing our own propulsion. Maybe it will take 2-3 years\nbecause there is an eligibility that one has to go through. So between 2-3 years’ time, we will be\nable to do our own propulsion for our Metro coaches also.\n\nAmtoj Singh: Got it, sir. Thank you so much. That was it from my side.\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sahil Kanade from Asian Market Securities.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nPage 9 of 14\n— TITAGARH\n// RAIL SYSTEMS LIMITED\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\n\nSahil Kanade: Hello. Thank you for the opportunity. My question is on rate order book. What proportion of\nyour current rate order book is linked to replacement versus new demand? And how do you see\nthis evolving over the next few years?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: So one is that as | have mentioned that we have an order book, which is giving us the visibility\nfor the next 4 quarters or so. As far as the new wagon order is concerned, today Indian Railway\nis moving about 1.6 billion tons of traffic. And the stated target of the railways is to move 3\nbillion tons by 2030. Considering that the wagons get replaced in between 25-30 years,\ndepending on the time when the wagons were added, because the older wagons had a shorter life\nthan the newer ones, we believe that the wagon demand should continue to remain healthy. And\ntherefore, that gives us the optimism that the new tender should come out somewhere in the\nbeginning of the next Financial Year.\n\nSahil Kanade: Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Disha from Sapphire Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nDisha: Yes. Firstly, thanks a lot for the opportunity. So sir, my question was on the PRS segment side.\nSo initially we had mentioned like the EBITDA margins will be hitting around 8%-9%. And\nthen as volumes start kicking in, we will be able to reach the 11%-12% margin level. So what is",

    "content" : "And the service is another business, which is a higher margin business where we can\nlook at an EBITDA of between 20%-25%. So if you look at the overall passenger rail segment,\nit is divided into these 4 SBUs as we have given out or laid it down in our strategic plan also and\neach one of the SBUs has its own margin profile. And we have tried to explain how each one of\nthe SBU is likely to ramp up in the period to come.\n\nDeepak: And then, sir, either on the SBU side, what would be the kind of margin we are looking out for\nthe Vande Bharat or what is the blended margin we are looking out for all the SBUs together?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I just gave you the numbers, sir. 11%-12%.\n\nDeepak: Thank you and wish you all the best.\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Thank you so much.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashish Shah from HDFC Mutual Fund. Please\ngo ahead.\n\nAshish Shah: Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, want to maybe dwell a little bit more.\n\nPage 11 of 14\n(_\\ TITAGARH\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Sir, your voice is very feeble.\n\nAshish Shah: Yes. Just one second. Better now?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Yes. Much better.\n\nAshish Shah: Yes. Sir, I just wanted to dwell a bit more on the shipbuilding side. So what type of vessels are\nwe talking about when we are saying 15-18 vessels a year, typically, what would be these\nvessels? And also, the other related subject also is that what will it take for us to be able to really\nbe able to manufacture this? Is there going to be a substantial amount of CAPEX or a capability\nbuildup or a technology tie-up? So if you can just maybe dwell a little bit on that?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Sure. Absolutely. So as we have explained that we are looking at doing this in a separate vehicle\nwith strategic/ financial partner and this company, we would like to grow and develop on its\nown. The parent company, which is Titagarh Rail System, does not want to keep this as a part\nof Titagarh Rail System because of the opportunity size being so high as we have expressed in\nthe strategic plan and outlook. The existing order book between the different businesses is close\nto Rs. 30,000 crores, Rs. 28,000-Rs. 29,000 crores today. And the new tenders that are there in\nthe market or likely to be there in the market is also very large. So we believe that there are 3\nbusiness segments in the company which the company has nurtured, the company has developed.\nThe primary business is the railway system business that would continue to be in the Titagarh\nRailway System umbrella. The other one is the marine or the shipbuilding side which is being\nspun off to Titagarh Naval Systems wherein we will induce about Rs. 50 crores of capital from\nthe company. And this company can then raise its own capital debt, etc., to build up the capability\nand the capacity. And the third for which the board has constituted a committee to evaluate is\nthe defense and bridge segment where the order book today is very small. It is almost\ninsignificant, less than Rs. 40 crores. But there does lie a very large opportunity in this segment\nbecause again here the company has in the past done a number of marquee projects for the Indian\nDefense Forces including some strategic equipments like nuclear, biological and chemical",

    "content" : "with this, we will be able to have a capacity of doing around 16-18 vessels per year and we are\nalready a naval-approved shipyard. So we are also working on enhancing the type of vessels that\nwe can deliver to the Indian Navy. And in our presentation also, we have given some of the\n\nvessels that we have manufactured in the past.\n\nPranjal Jain: Thank you. That is it from my side.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Balasubramanian from Arihant Capital. Please\ngo ahead.\n\nBalasubramanian: Good evening, sir. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Sir, you have mentioned 120 cars by\nthe end of the year on the passenger coach’s side. And whether you are completely ready with\nin terms of supply chain for specialized components, labor skilling, and like everything is ready\nfor the execution side, I just want to understand. And by its need also higher working capital\nside, how you are going to manage those?\n\nModerator: Just amoment. Ladies and gentlemen, the management line has been disconnected. I will quickly\nget connected. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the management line has been connected. Sir,\nplease go ahead.\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: There was a network problem and we lost the connection. So I was mentioning about the ramp-\nup that we are fully confident. And that is the reason we have given a complete roadmap of the\nramp-up that we will have not only for the current year, but for the coming few years. And also\nhow we are backed up with confirmed order books for the Metro Coach up to FY 28 and for the\nVande Bharat up to FY '31. As far as the working capital is concerned, the company has\nsufficient working capital limits, which is unutilized. And we are very comfortable in terms of\nthe working capital management.\n\nBalasubramanian: Sir, Firema is currently facing challenges. And what is the revised international strategy? Are\nthere plans to bid our international Metro or train contracts using the Indian manufacturing base?\nAnd we have in-house design capabilities also. And what we are going to do in Firema, whether\nwe are going to exit or is there any final solution that may be in a short period of time?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: So as far as Firema is concerned, there were multiple objectives for the investment into Firema.\nThe primary one of them was to be able to set up the facility in India with the transfer of\ntechnology, know-how and credentials. Titagarh has already been able to do that. Now, we are\na leading manufacturer of coaches, perhaps with the largest order book for passenger coaches in\nIndia. Today, our order book, including both Metro and Vande Bharat, is larger than what other\neven foreign companies or Indian companies in India have. And that has been possible because\n\nPage 7 of 14\n— TITAGARH\n// RAIL SYSTEMS LIMITED\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\nof the initial support that we had got from Firema. Now, that strategy is fully achieved and\naccomplished. And we had mentioned that the operational requirement and the capital\nrequirement of Firema that is required. It is a joint venture between us and the government of\nItaly. The government of Italy owns a little above 30% in that. So we are in discussion with them\nto dilute ourselves substantially and let one of the arms of the Government take control of that\ncompany. As regards the international strategy is concerned, the international strategy of\nTitagarh would continue to export, not to manufacture in Europe or other countries. And we will",

Good evening, everybody and thank you for joining the Q2 Earnings Call.\nAs you have already got the numbers, the new addition this time that has been given is the\nstrategic plan of the company, which for the first time we have been able to give a very clear\npicture on the trajectory that the company is hoping to follow in terms of the manufacturing\nsystem and the other businesses that the company is in.\nAs regards the current quarter is concerned, as I had mentioned earlier also, one month of this\nquarter was impacted by the wheel set availability and then the wheel set availability, which was\nprimarily impacting the company for the last 2 or 3 quarters, has been resolved. We have started\ngetting normal wheel sets from the month of August 2025. Now, the wheel set availability is\nnormal and we are back to a run rate of around 800 wagons a month and we intend to continue",

    "content" : "Mumbai is concerned, the first train should go somewhere in Q3 of next Financial Year, Q3 or\nQ4 of next Financial Year and then it will get ramped up. For Vande Bharat, again, we are\nintending to deliver the first train, the Vande Bharat Sleeper, the first car body is already made.\nAnd we are intending to deliver the first train in Q3 of the next Financial Year. So that is how\nthe ramp up will happen in all the passenger orders that we have. As far as the freight wagon is\nconcerned, we have an order of about 9,000 wagons. So that gives us visibility for the next\naround 4 quarters. We are considering the overall demand forecast and the traffic forecast that\n\nPage 3 of 14\n— TITAGARH\n// RAIL SYSTEMS LIMITED\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\ntargets that the railways have. We are hopeful that the tender should come out by Q1 of the\ncoming Financial Year. So we will have enough time to switch over or complete the existing\ncontracts and then get on to the new contracts.\n\nParvez Qazi: Thank you, sir. I will come back in the queue for more questions.\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amay Sharda from Purnartha Investment\nAdvisors. Please go ahead.\n\nAmay Sharda: Hi, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. I just wanted to ask, can you share the number, like how\nmany wagons did we send out in the September month, last month of Q2?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I am sorry, I didn't get your question. Can you repeat your question?\n\nAmay Sharda: So sir, in Q2, last month, like September, how many wagons did we produce, freight wagons?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: We do not give monthly figures, Mr. Sharda. We can only give you the quarterly numbers. We\nhave disclosed the quarterly dispatch of wagons in our presentation, which is 1,872 wagons\nduring Q2 of FY \"26.\n\nAmay Sharda: So just like and that has normalized now and we will do 800-850 going forward, right?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Yes, on an average, yes, approximately 800 wagons we should consider for the plans of\nexecution, although our capacity is 1,000 wagons, but in order to wait for the new tenders to\ncome in and till that time to have an even workflow, we are planning to do between 800-850\nwagons.\n\nAmay Sharda: And sir, next question was regarding the Line 5 and Line 6 Mumbai Metro order that we\nreceived. So like, can you bifurcate how much is the AMC value and how much is the value for\njust the delivery of wagons?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: So approximately, 15% is the AMC value and the balance is the supply value.\n\nAmay Sharda: 15% is AMC. And sir, one last question was regarding the tax rate?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: AMC is approximately 3% per year. That is the normal trend of Metro. In the case of Vande\nBharat, it is 4% per year.\n\nAmay Sharda: Got it. Last question was regarding the tax rate for this quarter. I think the tax rate was a little\nhigh. So any reason for that or will it get normalized going forward?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I will request the CFO to answer.\n\nPage 4 of 14\n— TITAGARH\n// RAIL SYSTEMS LIMITED",

    "content" : "which has been there has been primarily or I would say to a great extent, many of the customers\nare looking at wagons on long-term lease models. And in order to be able to offer or capture that\npart of the market or have more effective private sector demand, we have taken a wagon leasing\nlicense. We also believe that there have been newspaper reports that maintenance of wagon is\ngoing to be permitted to the leasing companies of wagons or the wagons that are given on lease\ncan be maintained by the owner of the wagon which are the leasing companies. We believe that\n\nPage 13 of 14\n— TITAGARH\n// RAIL SYSTEMS LIMITED\n\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\n\nNovember 18, 2025\n\nis a very interesting business to be in. So in order to be able to enhance the market share in the\n\nprivate sector business and also keep the options for maintenance of wagons open with us, we\n\nhad the experience or we made the qualification license to get to the license thanks to leasing\n\ntransaction that the company had done in the past for wagons to the Indian Railways. So we have\n\napplied and we are hopeful of getting this license soon.\n\nSandeep Mukherjee: Thank you, sir.\n\nModerator: Thank you.

I would only like to close by\nonce again drawing attention to the strategic plan and the outlook document that the company\nhas presented which gives a complete roadmap of how the company is likely to develop and the\ntrajectory of how the company is going to make a tectonic shift from being predominantly a\nfreight company to a passenger train and Metro coach and a high-value-added commodity\nmanufacturing company and how the strategic joint ventures that the company has is likely to\nbenefit both strategically and financially, the overall size and the balance sheet of the company\nin the years to come.

    "content" : "there are any execution risks that you foresee on the passenger side or any supply chain issues\nthat one can kind of foresee in the near future?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Yes, Pranjal. So thank you. We have already factored those in. We have been in this business\nfor a while now. We started making Passenger coaches or Metro coaches in 2021 in the Uttarpara\nfactory. And the reason why we have, for the first time, put out the ramp up and standardize our\nproduction setup. And we are confident of being able to achieve the ramp up run rate that we\nhave given in our presentation. In terms of supply chain problems in our industry, supply chain\nproblems is almost like goes hand in hand with existence. So we will continue to have that\nproblem somewhere or the other, and the bottleneck keeps on shifting. So that is exactly where\nwe have been prepared for and we have geared ourselves up for to be able to address all these\nissues as they come along. I would also like to state that one thing that we have now taken up\nand to a great extent has been implemented and balance will be implemented within this\nFinancial Year is a lot of backward integration in terms of making of these coaches. So all supply\nchain that we were dependent on for making car bodies within this financial year, in March this\nyear, we will have almost entirely, 100% will be in-house with us. So that we will address a\ngreat deal of supply chain technologically and facility-wise, process-wise, approval-wise, order-\nwise, we are all geared up.\n\nPranjal Jain: Sure, sir. And secondly, if you could kind of elaborate a bit more on the shipbuilding and what\nare the prospects and what kind of addressable market did you see? These will be my questions.\nThank you.\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I am sorry, I just lost your question. You said on the shipbuilding, what is the question?\n\nPranjal Jain: On shipbuilding, if you can elaborate, what kind of segments are we targeting? What is the\naddressable market? Which are the key capabilities that we are kind of targeting towards?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: So as far as the shipbuilding is concerned, over the last few years, we have delivered more than\n35 vessels to the Indian Navy, to the Coast Guard, to the National Institute of Ocean Technology,\nto GRSE. We have also exported a vessel to Guyana. So we have developed a great deal of\ncapability over the last 5-7 years that we have been in this business. And now, in line with the\ngovernment's policy, where the Government of India has decided that India must be Atmanirbhar\nalso on the shipbuilding side, the industry is being given a great deal of emphasis. So we have\nkind of been able to leverage upon all these expertise, the qualifications that we had in the past\nto be able to grow this business. So we will concentrate only on the specialized shipyards, apart\nfrom some very few bulk ships, which we can consider from time to time. But primarily, our\n\nPage 6 of 14\n(_\\ TITAGARH\n\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\nfocus is going to be on specialized vessels. We will focus on vessels which are between 100-150\nmeters or 160 meters in length. And the yard that we are building in the South of Bengal, in\nFalta, where we have already got a jetty as well, a concrete jetty. And we had acquired this land\nby way of acquiring a company, or land from a company called Precision Shipyards. And so,",

    "content" : "Titagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\n\nSaurav Singhania: So yes, the tax rate was approximately 26 point something percentage, but it is the effect of\ncertain transactions when it happens during the quarter, but it will normalize over the year. It\nwill come down to almost like 25.5, which has been the standard rate for us.\n\nAmay Sharda: Sure. Thank you so much. That is it from my side.\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Yes. Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Archit Agrawal from Steptrade Capital. Please\ngo ahead.\n\nArchit Agrawal: Hello. Sir, you have given the guidance for 1,000 purchases per year for FY '26, right?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Can you please pick up the receiver and speaker? There is some disturbance on the line.\n\nArchit Agrawal: Hello. Sir, I think there is some network issue. Am I audible?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Yes, go ahead.\n\nArchit Agrawal: Sir, question is with regard to that guidance of the 1,000 coaches. So sir, is it still doable or not?\nAnd what is the progress? So when we look at this 6 months, so can you throw some light on\nthe first half number out of that 1,000 coaches guidance?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: We have not given any guidance for 1,000 coaches, sir. We have given guidance for between\n100-120 car coaches in this financial year. And we are well on track to be able to achieve that.\nWe have given this, released this guidance. So definitely, we were not able to achieve that.\n\nArchit Agrawal: When we look at quarter 1 guidance, so it shows 1,000 coaches or wagons per month, right?\nThat is the run rate for entire FY '26?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I think you are mixing up between the wagons and the coaches. Sir, wagons, there are two\nsegments that the company operates in, the freight segment and the passenger segment. The\ncapacity that we have for the freight segment is 1,000 wagons per month, which has been\nimpacted due to the wheel set problem. Now that the wheel set problem has been resolved, we\nhave a capacity to do 1,000 wagons. But to even out till the new tender is published and finalized\nby the railway, the company wants to do between 800-850 wagons, in order to even out the\nworkload in anticipation of the new tender. As far as the passenger coaches is concerned, Metro\ncoaches is concerned, we have given a guidance that this year we will do between 100-120 cars\nand we are well on track to be able to do that.\n\nArchit Agrawal: So sir, for this freight wagon, can we say for the second half, it will be 6,000 or 5,000?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I just mentioned it is going to be 800-850 wagons per month, sir.\n\nPage 5 of 14\n(_\\ TITAGARH\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\n\nArchit Agrawal: Understood. Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Pranjal Jain from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nPranjal Jain: Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, I have two questions. One is, I wanted to kind of understand\nin terms of execution risk, while you kind of elaborated on the freight side, but wanted to see if",

    "content" : "between 800 and 850 wagons per month going forward. We also believe that the wheel set\nproblem should be behind us as the joint venture of ours along with the Ramakrishna Forging to\nproduce wheels in Chennai will get operational by Q1 of next financial year. So this should be\na problem that has perennially been causing trouble to the industry, to the wagon industry. This\nshould be a problem of the past.\nPage 2 of 14\n@ TITAGARH\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\nAs far as the passenger rail business is concerned, we have got some very interesting new orders,\ntwo orders that we got from Mumbai for Mumbai Line 5 and Line 6 that build up the pipeline of\nthe Metro Coach business up to FY '28. The visibility is there with the order book. And we have\nalso given in the presentation a ramp-up plan of the different SBUs of the passenger rail system,\nwhich is the Metro SBU, the Vande Bharat and the Passenger Train SBU, as well as the\nPropulsion SBU. And we are fairly confident of being able to achieve the targets of all these\nSBUs that we have given.\nSo with those few introductory comments, I would be very happy to take any questions.\n\nModerator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the\nline of Parvez Qazi from Nuvama Group. Please go ahead.\n\nParvez Qazi: Hi. Good evening, sir. Thanks for taking my question. So a couple of questions from my side.\nFirst, I think we have about 6 different orders in the passenger coach segment across Vande\nBharat and the 5 different metro rail projects that we have. It would be great to hear your views\non when can execution start on each of these individual fixed projects? And second is on the\nwagon business. It is great to hear that wheel set availability has now become normal and we\nhave ramped up to our usual range. With regards to future, what is our view on wagon tendering,\nespecially from the Indian railways? Thank you.\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Thank you, Parvez. So as far as the Metro or the passenger train rail segment is concerned, the\nsooner as you know we have already supplied, we have got the option that will be starting in 2\nyears' time. We have a delivery period of starting from 2 years to be ended in 2-1/2 years because\nthat is an Aluminium coach and we have already received the machines for making the\nAluminium coaches entirely in India. So the earlier contract that we had executed for Pune was\nexecuted by bringing in flat packs from Italy. But now we have set up the entire facility. The\nmachines have come. They are under installation. They will be getting into production sometime\nin Q1 of FY \"27. And we will be producing the entire car body of Aluminium for Pune in our\nplant in Uttarpara. As far as the Gujarat Metro is concerned, this quarter, that is Q3 of the current\nfinancial year, we will deliver the prototype. And then the production will ramp up in the manner\nthat is envisaged in the contract, so between 2 and 3 trains per month, going up to 3 trains per\nmonth. And we have given the overall numbers of coaches, which includes the Gujarat as well\nas the Bangalore that we intend to be able to deliver this year, which is between 100-120 cars,\nwhich is almost 8-10 fold jump over the number of cars that we delivered last year, which will\nagain almost double next year. So it is a huge ramp up that we are going to witness. As far as",

    "content" : "continue to pursue our endeavor to export products from India either to Firema or to other\ncustomers. But currently, the overall market and the order pipeline in India is very robust. So we\nare focusing primarily on the Indian market and developing additional capabilities and\ncompetencies like the Aluminium coach line. Because in most of these developed countries,\nEurope, etc., the coaches that they buy is of Aluminium and not of stainless steel. So over a\nperiod of time, we will re-enter in a significant manner the international market and start\nexporting coaches. But for the time being, we are not looking at manufacturing presence outside\nIndia.\n\nBalasubramanian: Sir, on that vessel business, we have 14-16 vessels per annum on the capacity side. And what is\nthe average realization per vessel and what upcoming deliveries are there? And what kind of\norder book we have right now? And what kind of enquiry pipelines we are witnessing?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Are we talking about the passenger side of Indian company?\n\nBalasubramanian: Vessel, sir. Ship.\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I am sorry. So ship building, we have already declared. We have about Rs. 500 odd crore order\nbook. And we have a very healthy pipeline of enquiries. We have been seeing a lot of\nannouncements from various ministries about their requirement of vessels. That will be in the\ncoming years we met from Indian shipyards. So we are seeing a very healthy pipeline. So we\ncannot disclose any of these till they are matured. Because we do not like to for both competitive\nreasons and for propriety reasons, we do not want to be announcing any one of them in haste.\nBut as they develop and they become mature, we will definitely come back and announce that.\n\nBalasubramanian: Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amitoj Singh from B&K Securities. Please go\nahead.\n\nAmitoj Singh: Thank you so much, sir, for taking my question. I had one question on the service side. I think I\nmissed that in the early part of the call. How much portion of the Mumbai Metro, both lines 5\nand 6, are service contracts?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Yes, sir. It is 15%. 15% is service and 85% is the supply.\n\nAmitoj Singh: Is the supply part. And when is scheduled to be started after the first delivery?\n\nPage 8 of 14\n@ TITAGARH\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: There is a 2-year warranty. Unlike Vande Bharat, where the service contract starts immediately\nafter delivery. In the case of Mumbai Metro, after the warranty period, there is a 2-year warranty\nand then there is the AMC contract that comes in.\n\nAmtoj Singh: Got it, sir. And sir, just wanted to ask you, what is the scope that you see in these service\ncontracts? And any guidance on how much margin we make on this contract?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Service is traditionally a high margin business. And the overall trend of the market is to go for\ncomprehensive contracts, which means supply plus servicing. We have seen that in Vande\nBharat, where the contract was placed with a supply with 35-year AMC. We have seen this in\nMumbai, where it is supply plus 5-year. And we believe that it may be also extended beyond 5\nyears. We are seeing that in other tenders that are coming out now. So we believe that this is\nsomething which is going to be the order of the day. And obviously, globally, the service",

    "content" : "warfare shelters, launching systems, etc. So this is something that is being evaluated. But the\nidea would be then again to see how all the 3 businesses can be grown but grown independently\nwithout dependence or interdependence on one another. As regard the kind of vessels that we\nare looking at doing in the shipbuilding, it is primarily as I said naval vessels or research vessels\nand some specialized vessels for the general maritime systems. We have done fast patrol vessels,\nwe have done diving support craft which is the first time diving support craft has been\nmanufactured, designed and manufactured in India. So vessels like these that is being targeted\nby us to be done in our shipyard.\n\nAshish Shah: Right sir. Sir, in the Mumbai Metro project you said that by 3Q or 4Q of FY 27 is when the first\ndelivery starts, the first train will get delivered. This is for both the packages or only the Line 5\nthat we were talking about?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I am sorry, I lost your voice. Can you repeat your question?\n\nPage 12 of 14\n— TITAGARH\n// RAIL SYSTEMS LIMITED\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\n\nAshish Shah: I am saying sir that we have 2 new orders from Mumbai Metro, the Line 5 and Line 6. Now, the\n3Q or 4Q FY \"27 timeline that you gave for the commencement of the delivery that is for both\nthe Lines or that is for maybe one of the Lines?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Sure, the delivery schedule for Line 6 is before Line 5, but the vehicles are going to be quite\nsimilar to each other. So we will adjust the delivery of the Lines based on the customer\nrequirement as such because there is not much of a difference between the Metro coaches for\nboth the lines. But since we had got the contract of the Line 6 before Line 5, there is a headway\nor earlier delivery for Line 6 by about 4-6 weeks, something like that, maybe 8 weeks.\n\nAshish Shah: Right, so it starts, let us say, end of by 3Q or 4Q of FY '27 and over what period the entire\ndelivery has to be done?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: And I am speaking from just memory here, so barring some errors, it will be completed in about\na year and a half or so from the day it starts. Between year and a half or 2, 18-24 months.\n\nAshish Shah: Alright, sir. That is all. Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next participant is from the line of Sandeep Mukherjee from SKP Securities\nLimited. Please go ahead.\n\nSandeep Mukherjee: Yes, sir. Thanks for taking my question. Can you throw some color on what adjacencies we are\nlooking forward in the vehicle leasing business?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I am sorry, what? Can you repeat your question, please?\n\nSandeep Mukherjee: Yes, sir. Sir, what adjacencies we are looking forward in the vehicle leasing business? Like we\nhave applied for the license for the vehicle leasing?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I didn't get your question. What adjacencies in the sense? I am sorry, I didn't understand.\n\nSandeep Mukherjee: Sir, we have applied for the vehicle leasing license?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Yes, that is right.\n\nSandeep Mukherjee: So what adjacencies we should look forward in this business, sir?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: I will answer it. Your question is what is this? So basically the private sector wagon demand",

    "content" : "like the sort of monthly run rate of coaches that we have to achieve in order to reach this 11%-\n12% margin level?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Yes, ma'am. So we believe that when we are able to, so the break-even point or the cut-off point\nto be able to get to this operating leverage is approximately 150-200 coaches a year, where we\nshould be able to reach the run rate from Q4 this year.\n\nDisha: That we are expecting to reach from this quarter 4, right?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: The Q4, we will be able to reach the run rate of 150-200 cars per year.\n\nDisha: All right. Understood. The second question was on the shipbuilding side. So I understand like it\nis at a very nascent stage. So it will take some time to ramp up. But like, say, 3-4 years down the\nline, what is the sort of revenue potential we see from this side? And also, how is the margin\nprofile?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: So ma'am, the shipbuilding, as we have given in our presentation, the capacity that we are\nplanning is for 15-18 vessels per year. And each vessel, depending on the intricacy of the vessel\nand the nature of the vessel, sells anything between Rs. 100-Rs. 250 crores per vessel. So that is\nthe kind of the addressable market that we are targeting. And we believe that the kind of market\nsize is very large, considering the focus of the government of discouraging import and Make In\nIndia self-reliant and self-sufficient in the shipbuilding. And normally, since we are going to be\nin the specialized shipbuilding sector if the industry gives about 15%-17% EBITDA margin.\n\nPage 10 of 14\n— TITAGARH\n// RAIL SYSTEMS LIMITED\nTitagarh Rail Systems Limited\nNovember 18, 2025\n\nDisha: 15%-17% EBITDA margin?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Yes. But as you very correctly said yourself, it is a very nascent stage of the ramp up of this\nbusiness. And things are still developing. But we are hopeful and we are confident of being able\nto get to these numbers.\n\nDisha: Alright. That is great to know. Thank you so much, sir. That is it from my side.\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Deepak from SVAN Investments. Please go\nahead.\n\nDeepak: Yes. Hi. Good evening, sir. | just wanted to check it out on this passenger side of the business.\nWe have given the production target of 200 and then scaling up to 300 for the Metros. And then,\nVande Bharat production is also scaling up from 32 to 192 in FY '28. In the PRA segment, we\nalready mentioned that we are looking at 12% kind of margin by Q4. If you can also give the\nbroader sense, once this Vande Bharat also comes into the picture when the production for this\nis, what kind of blended margin we would be looking at?\n\nUmesh Chowdhary: So as I mentioned earlier also in the earlier call, that Metro when we do our own propulsion,\nthen we are looking at an increase of EBITDA margin by at least 4%-5%. Till that time, we are\nlooking at both Vande Bharat and Metro at a margin profile of around 11%-12%. And the\npropulsion is a slightly higher margin business where we can target anything between 15%-20%\nof margin.",
