    "content" : "So fundamentally, like I said, this is provision for write-off and not really write-off. And\n\nsecond thing is, I think in the Iskraemeco's books, we are talking about the old receivables of\nabout some INR45 odd crores.\nThat is more a reconciliation with our company, which is happening. Once the reconciliation\nresults are there, then we'll reflect it in the individual standalone as well as consolidated numbers.\nBut we don't expect any major negative impact on a consolidated basis. but then there would be\nsome inter-subsidiary related transactions that we may have to recognize.\n\nManikantha Garre: Sorry, sir. I was asking about H1 FY 25 Iskraemeco numbers, where you mentioned about\ninventory write-offs and corporate cleanup. Firstly, these are not mentioned in Iskraemeco's\nP&L, FY 25 P&L. I don't see -- any number as the exceptional item.\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes, that's because we acquired the company. It happened when the company was outside this.\nSo as per accounting standards, we have made all the disclosures required. And I've also\nabundantly clarified that in the call, we'll put out as an FAQ too, so that it's factual in nature.\n\nManikantha Garre: Right, sir. And if I have to assume that the....\n\nPage 19 of 21\nPIKAYNES | o\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\nJairam Sampath: The inventory write-off will be found in the COGS line, sir. That's why the cost of goods sold\nhas increased and the profits have come down.\n\nManikantha Garre: Got it. And secondly, on the receivables for Iskraemeco in FY '25, there is an aging schedule\nthat was given. I would assume that the less than six months is pertaining to H2, and six months\nto one year is pertaining to Hl. I'm just trying to understand with such huge difference in\nrevenues for H1 and H2 of Iskraemeco financials, why the receivables difference is not showing\nthat much variance? See Iskraemeco H1 is significantly lower than H2.\n\nJairam Sampath: No Broadly, I will tell you. Broadly, I'll tell you numbers my friend, Senthil can quantify.\n\nSenthil: See broadly, the first half, whatever receivables are there pertaining to things that have happened\nin the past. Now, this is not necessarily one half or one period's result.\n\nAnd so when we acquired the company, we got a balance sheet while acquisition of the company\nand then we just consolidated that into our total standalone for Iskraemeco for the last year.\nSecond half, I mean, it's not really half but a second portion of the year, which is where we\npurportedly did about INR532 odd crores of business.\n\nSo that contains all the itemized details and they are pertaining only to the current business. The\nprevious ones would have a lot of items that need to be reconciled actually. And so that's why\nyou may not see a like-to-like comparison in the receivable profile with reference to the business\nprofile.\n\nManikantha Garre: Right, sir. And when have you moved from AMISP to completely providing product as a\nsolution?\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: No, no, no. We are working on AMISP model.\n\nJairam Sampath: Sir, we have already an existing contract with PGCIL. Bulk of it has been already done. Close\n\nto about 60-70% of that is completed.",

    "content" : "we'll be pursuing the target more than pursuing approval from these three customers, because\nthe approval from these three customers will help us to do good revenues, starting from FY 27\nonwards.\nNow, as far as the flow of subsidy, etcetera, is concerned, whatever little we have spent, and\nwherever there was dues from the government have been fulfilled within one week's time. Like,\nfor instance, we got the land related discount subsidies within one week of approval from the\ncentral government.\nSo, from the central government side, there is absolutely no delay. From our side, we had redone\nthe list of collaborators to reflect the correct reality, and that has been done. So anytime soon,\nwe'll start getting the, whatever capex we have done from our side, eligible capex, and that we'll\nget reimbursements.\nAnd then, pari passu basis, escrow account will be opened. So, we don't foresee any trouble. Just\nfor your information, we also put together a small team with a very qualified person to head this\nparticular subsidy management process within the company, so that it does not get, since the\nsubsidies are in thousands of crores, so we don't want it to be locked in the regular routine\nactivities. So we are making sure that there is a specific team working on it for documentation,\nfor complying with the requirements of the subsidy, etcetera.\nPage 18 of 21\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\nRenu Baid Pugalia: So at least from your end, because of a likely lag in the daily of capital subsidy from central\ngovernment, there would be no bloat on the working capital, or no bloat on the leverage on\nbooks, or delay of the project. It will be managed within the given timeline?\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes, yes, yes. And also, see, one of the things that we must note is that in the DPR, we normally\ndon't take too much of credit terms from suppliers, but most of the capex suppliers do give credit.\nSo, we will manage that judiciously to make sure that we not fall short of money, and there'll be\nno, let's say, reliance on our parent entity for doing the OSAT project. Other than the fact that,\nof course, the corporate related activities, other than that, money-wise, I think they are self-\nsufficient.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Ms. Pugalia, please reject the queue for more questions. Next question comes on the\nline of Manikantha Garre with Franklin Templeton India. Please go ahead.\n\nManikantha Garre: Thanks for the opportunity. Just a clarification and another question. In answer to the previous\nparticipant, you mentioned about the inventory write-off clarity from the inventory that was\ntaken in H1 of [skraemeco \"25. In your commentary to one of the questions you mentioned, there\nare drawbacks.\n\nModerator: Sorry for interfering. Your voice is breaking. Can you just come in the range and talk?\n\nManikantha Garre: How is it now? Yes, sir. So what I was trying to check was on the H1 FY '25 write-offs that you\nhave already clarified on, you gave a number. But to one of the questions, there are some broader\ncorporate cleanups as well. Could you also quantify that? And secondly, related to this, if I look\nat Iskraemeco's standalone P&L, all these one-offs are not mentioned in the P&L. I don't see any\nnumber as the exceptional items. Would you have any color on that? That's the first question.\n\nJairam Sampath: Sure.",

    "content" : "It's almost a little tad higher than the company's total growth rate. So from that perspective, I\nthink we should take -- we should be happy about the conclusion that other businesses are also\nshowing some strong performance.\n\nSameet Sinha: Got it. Thank you. The second question, as it relates to the various plans that you have in place,\nbill discounting, factoring, all of these, all of these have associated costs with them. Can you\ngive us an idea about how do you counter this cost so that your margins don't suffer?\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes. So, the supply chain finance, mostly especially, let me take the first one receivable. They\n\nare funded by foreign banks with decidedly lower rate of interest than what we actually get from\nour banks here. So, to that extent, keeping it in our books rather than this thing, maybe there's\nan improvement.\nThe only thing is the cost line item goes from one below EBITDA to above EBITDA. So earlier,\nif we were to borrow in India and then pay for it, then it will be shown as an interest. Whereas\nif I discount it, it goes into the cost. But at the net profit level, I don't see any adverse impact of\nthese steps that we are taking, including the ones which we are trying to do, factoring and these\nthings. We have done the math and it's not significantly altering the financials.\n\nSameet Sinha: Got it. Thank you very much.\n\nJairam Sampath: Thank you, Sameet ji.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Harinder Singh with Blackstone. Please go\nahead.\n\nHarinder Singh: Thanks for the clarification. So, I think I got answer to all the questions. Only one question is,\nsince now you are open to sell the 20% of the promoter stake, so any plans to reduce the stake\nfor going forward?\n\nJairam Sampath: At this point in time, we have not been informed by the promoters of any further dilution of the\nstakes or anything. Promoter stakes today, of course, we have complied with the requirements\nof RBI, etcetera, when SEBI, etcetera. So, promoter stakes today stand at around 52%, 53%.\nThey continue to remain this over the horizon that we can see and there is also no requirement\nto do that dilution by even any fundraise of that nature, at least in the near term.\n\nHarinder Singh: Thanks for the clarification.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Keshav Lahoti with HDFC Securities. Please\ngo ahead.\n\nKeshav Lahoti: Hello. I thank you for the opportunity. I just wanted a bit of thought. There was a small omission\nas you highlighted. Any thoughts or possibly as the company is growing big, maybe possibly\nget some bigger auditors once the current auditor tenure ends?\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes. So obviously, whatever, see, including additions to the team, strengthening all our\nresources, etcetera, these are all things which are constantly being discussed. And we have taken\n\nPage 10 of 21\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\nnote of, it is not because of this particular report that we have to do, but as a part of growing up,\nwe need to strengthen the partners in every age, each and every area.\nThis is a matter which is to be considered by our board and then appropriate decisions will be\ntaken. We'll make sure that on this front, we don't lack, but at the same time, the entire report is\nbased on one small error.",

    "content" : "Or next 2 years?\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes. So, from EMS business, we don't contemplate that there'll be any free cash flow, operating\n\ncash flow for sure. Then there'll be investing activities, which will basically lead to assets adding.\nSo, part of the efficiency improvement we will do by adding, I know, improving our asset turns\nin the EMS business itself by debottlenecking and by starting off clients which are already\nonboarded and client-specific assets which have been made.\nIn addition to that, we'll also add, because we slated for a fairly reasonable amount of growth. If\nyou take last several 4 years CAGR, the next few years CAGR also will be thereabouts. So, that\nwould, at some point in time, by the next year or so, we'll have to add the assets. And that will\ncome from our EMS business itself. So, OCF positive, yes. FCF, I'm not sure in the near-term\nthat will happen because we'll have to reinvest for growth.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Mr. Lohade, please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes in the\nline of Renu Baid Pugalia with IIFL Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nRenu Baid Pugalia: Yes, hi. Good morning, team. I have three questions. First, in Iskraemeco, while you did\nhighlight the performance of first half. Overall fiscal 25, which is a gross margin, looked fairly\nelevated or soft because of the impairment that has taken. So, can you quantify what was the\nimpairment done by the erstwhile management before the acquisition was closed, which has\ndeflated the gross margins for full year to just about 10% in Iskraemeco?\n\nSecond, you did suggest in the previous question that you can have revenues from Iskraemeco\n\nbusiness would just be about INR300 crores, while overall revenue growth will accelerate. So,\n\nfrom a general investor concern on growth in core EMS, can you highlight that after 42 billion\nPage 16 of 21\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\nkind of revenue guidance that we have seen in second half, which other segments in EMS do\nyou expect ramp up?\nSome more color in terms of how has been the performance for autos, acrospace, defense, IT,\nrail, EVs will be helpful. And lastly, on OSAT, can you give us a milestone while update in\nterms of while we have done the investment from our end, how is the capital subsidy from central\ngovernment expected over the next 12 months till we expect the full-fledged commissioning of\nour OSAT facilities?\n\nJairam Sampath: Thank you, Renuji. I think quite good questions. So, firstly, the Iskraemeco's first half last year,\nfirst half meaning I'm just calling it half, but the first portion of standalone financial last year,\nwe had instructed them to take a write-off of inventory which are not usable in the new\ngeneration of products, etcetera.\n\nThey had done a lot of experimentation over 3-4 years' timeframe, so that led to about INR44\ncrores of write-off of inventory on their books. And these are not pertaining to current\nbusinesses, but these are pertaining to items which they have acquired to do different types of\ndesign. As you know, with the acquisition of Iskraemeco, we got our own design solution for\nsmart meters.\nAnd of course, there was a small quantum about other expenses, roughly about INR6 crores. So",

    "content" : "this put together was about INRS0 crores, whereas they did business of about INR8S5 crores. So\nin that business, they actually made a turn that profit of two, but then this was minus 50 plus\ntwo, so it became minus 48.\nThe second half, obviously, without this burden, the company could turn around a good profit,\nI think around INR530-0dd crores of the sale after consolidation, revenues after consolidation.\nAnd then we did turn around about INR49-0dd crores of profits in that. So the net for the year\nstood at whatever number it did.\nThe second thing is the relative impact of, let's say, in the short run of any particular vertical. I'll\nbroadly take this question. Firstly, as of now, you'll be happy to note that in the second half, out\nof the remaining amount that we are going to do, guidance, Iskraemeco is not going to be\nsignificantly higher.\nIn fact, in terms of percentage, it will keep coming lower. And this is how it happens. Actually,\nif you see about 3 years ago, our growth was led by automotive sector generally, then for some\ntime, there was electric vehicles that grew the business. At some point in time, the business has\ngrown by, let's say, smart metering business.\nAnd then this year, the notable segments are there is a good growth in automotive. There's good\ngrowth in other industrial, other than smart meter. There is good growth in electric vehicles too.\nA few marquee customers, I can't disclose the name, but very good marquee customers have\nbeen acquired. And they have also kind of put new plans, increasing their volumes, etcetera.\nPage 17 of 21\nﬁ(AH!ONL EGSY Kaynes Technology India Limited\n- December 08, 2025\nThen there is railway -- one major resurgence of railways, we call it. 4 years ago, railway used\nto be about 30% of our business. And then over time, of course, it is dependent on a lot of other\nfactors. But we kept on our work with the result that we have now developed probably countries,\none of the most comprehensive coverage programs.\nSo, we have got approval and orders, etcetera. And then, of course, the last one is aerospace,\nwhich we have acquired a sizable amount of orders from one of the OEMs abroad. And this is\nincreasing also from their own statements in the media. Also, you can find out that they are, and\nour facilities also kind of completely come to completion and it's approved also. So, second half,\nyou can see fairly good growth with respect to these areas.\nNow, as far as the question on OSAT is concerned, we'll be happy to note that we have acquired\nthree clients. They all of them have themselves come out and given press statements, actually,\nbecause we are not allowed to talk about it unless we get consent. But they have, so these are\nAlpha Omega Semiconductor, Infineon, and the Larsen and Toubro's business takeover of one\nportion of Fujitsu General’s Semiconductor business.\nAnd all three of them, one of them, we were the first in the country to actually ship out the\nchipsets, even though we got this thing the last, the approvals the last. And so, the samples have\nbeen shipped out, so in some sense, technically, the commercial production has started. But of\ncourse, we are focusing on trying to get the sample approval from all of these customers before\nwe do a significant amount of business.\nSo, this year, while we did put a small target on us for revenues, but I'm not very sure whether",

    "content" : "Vijay Sarthy T S: Good morning, sir. Thanks for the opportunity and thanks for this clarification. Just one question,\nsir. Could you give us the breakup of consolidated PAT among subsidiaries for the second\nquarter and first half, sir?\n\nJairam Sampath: Breakup of consolidated PAT among subsidiaries?\n\nVijay Sarthy T S: Among subsidiaries, yes?\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes, it is there in the financials, it's published in the financials standalone for subsidiaries is\nalready and consolidation is also published. If you want, we can reiterate that today. We'll be\nanyway publishing Q&A there. So, we will put that there. Not a problem. Take a bit of time for\nthe holding subsidiaries.\n\nVijay Sarthy T S: Yes, sure. Thanks a lot. Thanks. That's it. Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Sudheer Guntupalli with Kotak Mahindra\nAMC. Please go ahead.\n\nSudheer Guntupalli: Yes. Hi, team. Firstly, I missed the question by one of the previous participants on the promoter\nstake sale. So, Jairam, what exactly is it about and the line was not very clear?\n\nJairam Sampath: No, he asked whether promoter stake will get diluted in the future. There are two ways in which\npromoter stake is diluted. One, if they sell directly as a block to a third party. Two, if we raise\nfunds into the company, then also promoter stake will get diluted. I said in both cases, there is\nno plan in the near term that we have contemplated.\n\nSudheer Guntupalli: Fair enough. And secondly, in the research report that we are talking about, some of the data\npoints which were very central to building a chain of seemingly speculative interpretations, like\nthe 28% net margin Iskraemeco in H2 FY '25, the way capitalization amount is calculated by the\nanalyst, including that assets from acquisition, tangible assets from acquisition, borrowing cost\nof 17% odd that was mentioned, etcetera., all seem to be factually incorrect. So, did you guys\nmake an attempt to reach out to the concerned analysts and maybe getting an erratum note\npublished?\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes. So, though the one particular list of things indirectly sent to us by the concerned analyst\nthrough some known channels to us, which we answered. Of course, there was a small delay of\n\nPage 12 of 21\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\n5 days, 10 days before we could answer because people were traveling and we needed to verify\nall the facts, etcetera, but then this was shared well before they published the report. And so,\nspecifically, nobody really asked questions on any of these kinds of things.\nSo, as a part of Q&A, we have answered these actually. Perhaps the analyst felt that he was not\nsatisfied, so he anyway went ahead and published it. But anyway, we have clarified it and today\nwe'll reiterate. See, our job is to make sure that we are more transparent as a company and then\nwe explain exactly what we meant.\nAnd in the entire episode, if you really see, there's only one item which has caused this entire\nflood of speculation. So, we will make sure that next time even that small opportunity is not\ngiven. So, I don't want to, I don't wish to comment on why or there are many wrong assertions\nhe has made.\nSo, I would rather focus on informing our valued investors about what exactly the facts are and",

    "content" : "the management today, being represented by Ms. Savitha Ramesh, Chairperson, Mr. Ramesh\nKannan, Executive Vice Chairman, Mr. Muthukumar Narayanaswamy, Managing Director, Mr.\nJairam Sampath, Whole-Time Director and CFO.\n\nNow, I'll hand over the floor to the management for their opening remarks, post which we'll open\nthe floor for Q&A. Thank you and over to you, sir.\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: Good morning, everyone. On behalf of Kaynes Technology team, I'd like to address certain\nobservations that have been raised around our disclosure and accounting presentations. I wish to\naddress all our stakeholders, shareholders directly and unambiguously.\n\nWe acknowledge that a few disclosures required clearer clarification and articulation. These\nwere errors in reporting of disclosure in notes to accounts and not lapse of intent, governance or\nconduct. The management acted immediately.\n\nWe issued a detailed clarification addressing every point raised. And we have already begun\nstrengthening our internal compliances, audit review processes and disclosure checks to ensure\nsuch instances do not reoccur. Let me reiterate this firmly that there are no governance concerns\nand no underlying deterioration in business.\n\nKaynes has always operated within a framework of strong ethics, transparency and\naccountability. And this remains non-negotiable. At the same time, the company continues to be\ndeeply focused on its long-term growth roadmap.\n\nOur OSAT initiatives is progressing well and positions India meaningfully in the global\nsemiconductor value chain. Our high-end PCB program strengthens domestic manufacturing in\na largely imported independent category. Working capital normalization measures are already\nunderway and expected to show visible improvement going forward.\n\nKaynes remains a structurally strong story with significant headroom for value creation. Our\ngrowth drivers, strategic directions and execution momentum remains solidly intact. From here\nonwards, my team will present the detailed clarification and all observations.\n\nJairam Sampath: Thank you. A very good morning to all participants. Thank you for joining in so early on a\nMonday morning. So there were some observations made for which we have already published\n\nPage 2 of 21\nPIKAYNES | o\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\nsome of the answers on top questions. And then I would like to just quickly focus on those which\nwe thought we require reiteration.\nSo one of the first items was that Iskraemeco’s high contribution revenue profit is noteworthy.\nSo Kaynes reported FY25 revenues of 27.2 billion, 51% year-on-year increase. And he has put\nsome exhibit.\nThis gentleman who has done the analysis and slightly below the guidance, 1 did by\nconsideration of Iskraemeco smart metering business for six months and so on. I'm sure you\nhave this report already available with you. So one of the first implication, now these are not\nfacts, but these are implications made by the analysts.\nIt says my 28% net margin, second half FY 25, which looks high for smart metering business.\nNow the H2 FY '25 net margin is only 9% actually, the revenues of INR5,327 million and PAT\nof INR489 million. So the 28% margin cited appears incorrect.\nThe second question, the second observation, second implication, because he's only said this\nimplies INR483 million loss in first half reconciled with the full year profit of INR6 million.\nThis is context of a profitable FY '24, no evident cost drivers in first half FY '25 for such a swing.\nWe should understand that the H1 FY '25 loss is driven by a combination of factors.",

    "content" : "The observation on aged receivables pertain to dues between parent\nand subsidiary firm. Given that these are intercompany receivables and payables, the standard\ncredit periods are strictly adhered to as these balances do not have any impact on the consolidated\nbalance sheet as these are eliminated during the consolidation process.\nThen there is a comment on rising CCC, dense OCF, cash conversion cycle, dense OCF post\ninterest, high capex for OSAT, PCB, raise on FCF. Now he's talked about Kaynes operating\ncosts, cash flow post interest stood negative at 0.9 billion in FY '25, primarily due to working\ncapital requirements and he's talked about some Exhibit, etcetera. The consolidated cash\nconversion cycle increased by 22 days to 157 days, etcetera.\nSo our response is as follows. Firstly, the working capital intensity is typical to the EMS industry\nand multiple initiatives are underway to improve it, including collaborating with onboarding\nlarge customers into supply chain finance program, leveraging factoring and bill discounting and\ndriving inventory optimization. The second aspect is capex requirements are long-term in nature\nPage 5 of 21\nKAYNES | o\n|$ TECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\n- December 08, 2025\nand are only adequately funded through equity with capital subsidies expected to start flowing\nfor capex is already incurred.\nAnd third one is the, our response is the net working capital cycle inventory days plus receivable\nminus payable days calculated as per ICAI guideline. Note that guidance note is 87 days in FY\n'25, up from 83 days in FY '24, increase of four days year-on-year. Traditionally, the inventory\ndays calculated report appear to be based on cost of sales, whereas the report stated definition is\nbased on revenue.\nThen there's a comment on elevated capex plan spending, grant timelines may influence funding\nand capital allocation strategy. And then, of course, he's written a few things. Some of them\ncould be facts based on published data.\nOur response is as follows. First balance requirement for OSAT INR10.3 billion will be funded\nthrough QIP and spent amount of about 3.8 billion and balance internal accruals capex spread\nover five years and some transitory debt. Second thing is that with regard to PCB, the current\nplan includes only capex of 14 billion for which the balance requirement is 3.2 billion and up\ncentral government subsidy of about 3 billion.\nThe same will be funded through QIP and spend amount of 1.6 billion internal accruals and debt.\nThe feasibility of planning expansion to PCB business will be evaluated after discussion with\nthe state governments on the subsidies and after due process internally. Further, while\ncalculating interest cost on the average borrowings, we need to consider bill discounting. The\ninterest cost will work out approximately 10% including all bills discounted.\nThen there is a comment on receivables, discounting and provisioning could impact profitability\nmargins. And of course, he has described something that he has read from the statements. Our\nresponse is that discounting cost in the long term, smart metering receivables is already\nembedded in the contract pricing and bill discounting is undertaken judiciously based on the cost\nbenefit assessment. With respect to receivables provisioning, all provisions are made strictly in\naccordance with the company's ECL, or expected credit loss policy.\nThen he's talking about variations in cash flow statement versus asset additions. And he says\nKaynes FY '25 cash flow statement report purchase of fixed assets of 9.5 billion. It does not fully\nreconcile the 7.",

    "content" : "There is a small portion remaining. This is contractual in\nnature. We cannot get away from it.\nBut all the other ones are all based on our EMS type of model wherein there is a definitive period\nfor payment. It is not extended beyond one year. So other than PGCIL contract, all other\ncontracts are all non-AMISP, which you can say that after we have taken over many new orders\nthat have come in all from non-PGCIL book direction is all non-AMISP type of.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we have reached the end of question-\nand-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing\ncomments.\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes, sir. So I would like to thank all the participants who take a time on early morning. And I'll\nrequest our Executive Vice Chairman, Mr. Ramesh Kannan, to just make some closing remarks,\nso that we can close the session.\n\nPage 20 of 21\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: Actually, our plan is to more and more concentrate on our main business that is EMS. We have\nworked very hard in the last eight months and we have acquired a lot of aerospace customers,\ndefense customers. We have got railway new products. Earlier, we were only in signaling in\nrailway.\n\nToday, we have got into rolling stock. Then Kavach, we have added. So, our main concentration\nwill never move out from EMS, and we are committed to that. And this will help us to get more\nand more orders and march towards our mission on whatever guidance we have given you in the\npast.\n\nRegarding structural improvement, we have added more people on the taxation side, more\npeople on finance, manufacturing, and brought more leadership into the company. And we are\ncommitted. We'll also re-examine, revisit our structural as well as communication models. And\nwe will improve from this. This, I thought I should add as a total thing. Since our auditor, Mr.\nMohan Lavi, is also there in the call. Mr. Mohan, you would like to add something?\n\nMohan Lavi: No, sir. Generally, I think I agreed with most of the points mentioned, nothing specific. But just\nto assure all of you all that, yes, we are seized of the note which has been given and the company\nhas proactively taken measures to actually strengthen their internal control process.\n\nIn fact, most of the data will now flow from the ERP system itself so that manual intervention\nis minimized. So, I'm sure that going forward, we will be able to sort of get into a better\ntransparency, better disclosure, and ensure that things are all correct.\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: Thank you, Mr. Mohan, and thank you all parties interested in Kaynes as well as invested in\nKaynes, our stakeholders. Thank you very much.\n\nJairam Sampath: Thank you very much.\n\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of Kaynes Technology India Limited, that concludes this conference.\nThank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.\n\nPage 21 of 21",

    "content" : "We have already described earlier what these are\nmeant for. So the net goodwill stroke capital reserve in consolidation was about minus INR\n10.31 million.\nIn the acquisition of Iskraemeco, the difference between consideration paid and the net assets\nacquired was credited to capital reserve. And this was due to the fact that we recognized\nintangible assets, that is, customer contracts, as part of the acquisition as permitted by the\nparagraph 13 of the Ind AS 103, business combinations.\nIn the acquisition of Sensonic, there was no specific intangible asset acquired. And hence, the\ndifference between the consideration paid and the net assets acquired was accounted as goodwill.\nThe paragraph 17 of Ind AS 1 state that the entities shall present information including\naccounting policies in a manner that presents relevant, reliable, comparative information.\nIt was felt that there is only one applicable accounting standard for acquisition, and it would not\nhave been relevant to present capital reserve as part of one acquisition and goodwill as part of\nanother. Due to this, these have been netted off to present the financial statement in a relevant\nand reliable manner.\nThe second observation that has come out in the report is no corresponding value adjustment\ndisclosed on acquisition and is cited from Exhibit number 5 or something. To that, our assertion\nfrom the company side is the comparison basically is incorrect. The payment of acquisition of\nsubsidiaries is disclosed on a separate line item in the stand-alone financial statements only.\nThe consolidated financial statement, all assets and liabilities acquired are included in their\nrespective categories during the consolidation process and reflected within the corresponding\nPage 4 of 21\nﬁ(AH!ONL EGSY Kaynes Technology India Limited\n- December 08, 2025\nmovement in the net cash flows. And then there are some mentions of reports and significant\nadditions in tangible assets for technical know-how in FY '25.\nThis is just an observation which says Kaynes capitalized INR1.8 billion, that is 6.5% of revenue\nas additions under technical know-how and including designs and prototypes of FY 2025. He\ncited some exhibits, INR141 million was R&D expense, etcetera. Balance in our view is likely\nto be prototyping costs. So, we can't comment on his view because this is not based on facts, but\nwe can clarify here from our side, company’s side.\nIntangible assets recognized in FY 25 comprise the following. One, INR1,150 million of\ncustomer contracts arising from the Iskraemeco acquisition classified under technical know-how\nas the key component related to design implementation know-how, hosting and communication\npackage for smart metering. INR260 million for development and costs related to the\nacquisition. And then remaining capitalization attributable to in-house R&D for the development\nof proprietary products. It would not be appropriate to compare intangible assets arising from a\nbusiness combination with recurring R&D capitalization.\nThen the report published by Kotak Securities talk about disclosures for related party\ntransactions balance inconsistent. And as they have said, we have observed inconsistencies in\ndisclosure made by stand-alone entities and various subsidiaries, etcetera. So, this related -- our\nresponse is as follows.\nThe related party transactions were appropriately eliminated and consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with Ind AS. The oversight pertains solely to the notes to the stand-\nalone financial statements in one of the companies, but the disclosure was inadvertently omitted.\nThe underlying financial statement and schedules themselves were correct. So, there is no\ninconsistency actually speaking. It was just a small error of typographical nature in one of the\nsubsidiary financials.\nThe disclosure has since been rectified and noted for future compliance. Transaction was\nrecorded in both the entities.",

    "content" : "First is significantly lower revenue, which is about INR8S5 crores or INR851 million, while fixed\ncosts have been remaining largely unchanged. Second thing is provision arising from Kaynes\ndue diligence, including inventory write-offs. And third thing is broader corporate cleanup and\nother adjustments.\nSo if these questions were probably asked to us in advance, and then the implications that the\nanalyst has actually written were stated, then we could have made this correction. But\nunfortunately, I think these implications were stated without full understanding of the facts. A\npayback period of less than six months for Iskraemeco acquisition.\nYes, the erstwhile parent was a global enterprise that chose to exit India as a part of its strategic\nshift to other regions. Since they were unable to set up full-fledged operations in India incurring\nsignificant losses, they were unable to commence metering delivery in large scale. Kaynes had\nalways been a supplier partner since Iskraemeco's India entity, and hence Kaynes was able to\nstrike a bilateral deal and negotiated the same at an attractive price.\nGoodwill recognition and reserve adjustment acquisition ambiguous. Now, the word ambiguous\nis written by the report. There is nothing ambiguous about it, though. Kaynes, the report goes on\nto say Kaynes acquired Iskraemeco in Sensonic in FY 2025 on a consideration of INR883\nmillion, recognizing a goodwill of INR1,140 million or INR114 crores. And he's put some\nexhibit there. We observe that the consolidated balance sheet does not show a corresponding\nincrease in goodwill.\nInstead, it reflects a net negative adjustment of some amount in net capital reserve, etc. So you've\nseen these comments. So she notes, so the response to this is in FY 2025, the company made\nPage 3 of 21\nﬁ(AH!ONl EGSY Kaynes Technology India Limited\n- December 08, 2025\ntwo acquisitions, namely Iskraemeco and Sensonic, which resulted in capital reserve of goodwill\nand goodwill respectively on these transactions after assigning values to the net identifiable,\nidentified assets as part of the purchase price allocation exercise carried out as required under\nthe Ind AS 103.\nAs far as the acquisition of Iskraemeco is concerned, the identified intangible asset customer\ncontract was an amount of INR115 crores or INR1,150 million, which is recognized under the\nblock technical know-how as a significant factor for design, implementation know-how, hosting,\nand communication package for smart meter. Further, the table below provides a detailed\ngoodwill and intangible assets recognition. We'll be publishing this particular thing post this call.\nBut broadly, it says net assets, I'll take column by column and then the total so that you will get\nto know the actual calculation. So, let's say for Iskraemeco, the net assets were minus INR198.65\nmillion. Consideration was plus INR429.86 million. So, the total amount was plus INR628.51\nmillion. Intangible assets recognized were INR1,150 million. So net goodwill or capital reserve\nin consolidation was minus INR521.49 million. The same for Sensonic was net assets were\nminus INR58.22 million. Consideration was INR452.95 million plus. So total amount of\nINRS511.18 million, which flows directly to net goodwill or capital reserve in consolidation. So,\nwhen we total these two lines, the net amount for net assets is minus 256.87 million.\nConsideration was INR882.81 million. The total amount stands at INR1,139.69 million.\nIntangible assets recognized were INR1,150.",

    "content" : "current receivables plus, there are certain receivables which are beyond, not due within the year,\nbut due after the year, including that is about INR687 crores of the total receivables.\n\nOut of which, we had also talked about making sure that this approximately INR240 crores\nwhich pertains to these other non-current assets, we'll try and get it discounted off our books.\nAnd the remaining one, whatever gets added will get added, and then collection cycle also, we're\ntrying to see to it that from the current slightly elevated numbers, with some efficiency\nimprovements in installations and all that.\n\nAnd also, I think the overall RDSS program performance is also improving. So, we will try and\ncollect it within a reasonable amount of time, not later than what we already have on our books.\n\nAchal Lohade: Understood. And what about the first half of FY '26 in terms of revenue and profit?\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes, we had talked about it, sir. As of end of September, the total receivables, including other\nnon-current assets, INR687. Revenues will be of the order of about INR500-0dd crores in the\nfirst half. Exact number, I'm not able to disclose that to you. And then, of course, in the second\nhalf, we also plan some execution, which will be of the nature of about INR300-o0dd crores. So,\nthese are the numbers as far as the smart metering business is concerned.\n\nMind you, this contains not only the erstwhile contracts of Iskraemeco, but also the newer ones\nwhich we have received as non- AMISPs business, which is the device and solutions.\n\nAchal Lohade: So, just to clarify, INR500 crores odd is recognized in first half, and another INR300 crores\nwould happen in second half. Have I understood right, sir?\n\nPage 15 of 21\nPIKAYNES | o\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes, this is approximately correct. I'm not able to give you sharp answers...\n\nAchal Lohade: Yes, broadly. And this INR500 crores, whatever revenue is booked in first half will get collected\nin the second half. Would that be a fair assessment? I'm coming to the next question with respect\nto receivables. Obviously, by 31st March, 26th? Yes, sir.\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes, sir. Our endeavor is to collect that. There would be a small portion of it. We will — will\n\nprobably go into the other non-current assets because this is still a bulk of the revenues pertaining\nto the revenue from the previous contract that we got on our hand after acquisition. So, you're\nright.\nBroadly, that's the direction for all the current receivables, and that there could be a quantum of\nINR100 crores-INR200-o0dd crores, which we may have to do some documentation before we\ncan, say, quote, unquote, collect it in our books. So, you're right. Directionally, we should do\nthat. Maybe about INR100 crores-INR200 crores would still require some work from our side.\n\nAchal Lohade: Got it. And second question, would there be a free cash flow generation out of your EMS\nbusiness over the next couple of years, given the kind of growth rate that we are talking about,\nthe asset turns, what this EMS business requires? Is it fair to say that most of the cash generated\nwill get consummated for the EMS capex itself?",

    "content" : "It's more like a consolidation related activity, which probably will close it\nbefore the year end.\n\nAs far as the specific order number for this, we don't normally publish order book by customer\nfor the sake of confidentiality. We need their consent before we can actually give this. But suffice\nPage 8 of 21\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\nit to say that the percentage of total business of smart meter as a percentage of total business is\ntrending down for the simple reason that other businesses also showing some strong growth rates\nin the other verticals.\nSo going forward, the reliance on this particular thing will certainly come down. And then, of\ncourse, it's getting replaced by equally good and worthy businesses. And so we hope that this\ntrend continues over the next decade or so.\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: We are also planning to exit from day one. When we took over this company, we wanted only\nto become a device manufacturer. So, we will no longer be an AMISP company. We will be\nonly device company to various AMISPs. And our software, we will also sell it to them as a\nservice.\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes, it's more like a product solution manufacturing rather than full project implementation. And\nwe already are well on our way. And there are many orders, significant orders that we have\nactually received for devices too, with many customers other than Iskraemeco also.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Mr. Bera, please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes in the\nline of Sameet Sinha with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\n\nSameet Sinha: Yes, thank you very much. So, my first question is about the organic growth rate. Can you\n\nprovide some clarifications on what's the proposed, what was said in the report about the organic\ngrowth rate in the first half?\nAnd then can you also kind of look forward and talk about how you plan on growing the\nbusiness? Obviously, the metering business is probably a fixed revenue contribution every year.\nI think that's what Jairam you mentioned. How about the other businesses? What are the growth\ncatalysts moving forward? And then I will have a follow-up?\n\nJairam Sampath: Thank you, Sameet ji. So, you're right. The metering business is more like a run-rate business.\nAnd we know that this is broadly driven by the RDSS program of the government, wherein about\n250 million homes will have smart meters, etc. So, it's got a limited cycle of 10 to 12 years’\ntimeframe. And so, we are dealing with it in the same manner.\n\nAs far as the other verticals are concerned, there is strong growth in automotive, there is strong\ngrowth in industrial other than smart meters, there is strong growth in electric vehicles. Also,\nnow the resurgence of strong sectors like railways, electronics, as well as aerospace, outer space\nand defense, and also in IT field. So, we see a resurgence of growth in most of those areas to\nmore than compensate for any reduction in the composition of business from the smart meter\nperspective.\n\nNow, just a small comment compared to last year to this year. Actually, if you were to, we have\ndone an internal match. Without disclosing what I am not supposed to disclose, but then the\ngrowth rate in other parts of business compared to FY 25 to FY '26 projected plan, the growth\nrate of other businesses other than Iskraemeco is fairly strong.\n\nPage 9 of 21\nKAYNES o\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025",

    "content" : "So we just want to be mindful of the fact that the confirmation for this\nis to make sure that we get a software to do the contra entries of notes to accounts for the RPTs,\nwhich you have taken into account.\nAnd whatever else measures that are required, including taking help for analytics and some of\nthese international firms, etcetera, we will do. We are also doing it in some small way and then\nwe will definitely increase the, let's say, engagement on that front.\n\nKeshav Lahoti: Understood. Got it. Last question from my side. If we see your R&D expense, most of that it is\ncapitalized. So what is that and how you -- which expense you charge in P&L and which you\ncapitalize? And lastly, if we see your bad debt provision, that is 3.5% of sales in H1, why the\nbad debt has increased and should we expect any increase in bad debts in upcoming times?\n\nJairam Sampath: Could you repeat the first part of the question? I just missed it due to error...\n\nKeshav Lahoti: If we see your R&D expense, so majority of it is capitalized. So how you decide what should be\ncapitalized and what should be charged off and what it was got into?\n\nJairam Sampath: I will. Yes. So, Mr. Lahoti there were two questions. One question was regarding the research\nand development-related policies and the second part of the question was on...\n\nKeshav Lahoti: Bad debts that was 3.5% of sales in H1 was very high?\n\nJairam Sampath: Okay. I will address the second part of the question first. A bad debt provision does not mean\nit's a bad debt written off. It's a provision for write off as per the accounting policies and the\nECL that we discover. And then obviously, it's also advised by the auditors. Now,\nfundamentally, our efforts to collect our money continues, even after the provision is made for\na particular bill.\n\nAnd whenever we collect that particular relevant invoice, then we can write back that into our\nP&L. So, provision is not equal to write off. And in our businesses, because it's a custom-built\nbusiness, the write offs, etcetera are generally very small in nature because we undertake projects\nand production only on the basis of what the customer wants.\nAs far as research and development is concerned, I just want to point out as an answer to this is\nthat we have developed something called Kavach program, which others have probably, there\nare other players who had a lot of trouble in developing, but we have developed using German\ntechnology and all that.\nSo, in our case, what happens is, whenever we do research, that means there is no specific\nproduct that is being developed, but the engineers are just experimenting with new concepts and\nPOCs, etcetera. Those are all generally expensed off and they are not capitalized.\n\nPage 11 of 21\nPIKAYNES | o\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\nOnly when we identify a particular product with a revenue stream possibility, we take it as\ndevelopment and that is capitalized. And until the time when we start the revenue cycle, the\nmoment revenue cycle comes, then amortization will start. So, it's a very practical way of not\nrecognizing things which are experimental in nature and recognizing things which are actually\ndevelopmental in nature.\n\nKeshav Lahoti: Got it. Thank you, sir. Quite helpful.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Vijay Sarthy T S with Subhkam ventures.\nPlease go ahead.",

    "content" : "wherein, like I said, once the research phase is over and then we get into a targeted development\nof the product, the solution, then we start capitalizing those. And we will probably come to --\nwe will publish this information, sir. Just give us some time.\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: ODM is a part of our main core business, EMS. So, this will be a continuous activity. We have\nto give solutions, upgrades to people. That becomes a major business for the next four to five\nyears. So, in our EMS, our type of industry in aecrospace, defense, railways...\n\nJairam Sampath: Industry, so on.\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: This will continue, and then we need to do that. If you see, this company has come out in an 11-\nmonth period and full-fledged Kavach. And we have got approval as well as we have got orders\nfrom the railways.\n\nJairam Sampath: So, we will publish this number separately. It is part of the chart of accounts that we have\npublished, but we will point it out and give it to you.\n\nIndrajit Agarwal: Sure, this is helpful. Second, on the overall internal control issue, again in March, we had some\nscrutiny from SEBI on some disclosure of SDD, etcetera. So, how are we? Because we are now\na large company with a sizable market cap, sizable top line, much more ambitious growth going\nahead.\n\nSo, do you think there is something that structurally needs to change, one, in the way you manage\nthings, and second, in the way you communicate things, as the previous participant mentioned?\nSo, is it more of a structural reform that you need, or what we are doing currently, we will\ncontinue to work with?\n\nPage 14 of 21\nPIKAYNES | o\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: I fully understand what you are saying. Structurally, we are continuously working and\n\nimproving, because we started as a small company, and from there we grew up, and then\ncontinuously we are growing. Our pace of growth is very high.\nEMS is a deeply involved type of industry, but world over it is, all are in billions of dollars. So,\nwe also need to scale up. Having said that, structurally, we will take somebody's advice and we'll\nstart working with people to structurally improve, as well as we will also get into our\ncommunication a little better. If this has taught us a lesson, we will get there.\n\nIndrajit Agarwal: Thank you. That's all from my side.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Achal Lohade with Nuvama Wealth\nManagement Limited. Please go ahead.\n\nAchal Lohade: Good morning, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. Just two questions. First, if you could clarify,\nwith respect to receivables, Iskraemeco is our 100% subsidiary. So, I don't see a challenge in\nterms of disclosing what exactly their revenue and the profits were for the first half of FY 26,\nand how much is the receivable as of 30th September 2025. If you could talk about that, and\nthen I'll ask a follow-up question, sir.\n\nJairam Sampath: Well, we had answered this question. I think the very first question was on this topic. We can\ntell you, H1 receivables, how much is Iskraemeco and, smart meter. So, the Iskraemeco",

    "content" : "you can sort of talk about some of these things.\n\nManagement: Yes, yes. So firstly, we cannot actually give very detailed granular information about customer\nwise receivables and so on, because this has got business confidentiality linked to it. But\nhowever, broadly I can tell you that the Iskraemeco’s business, which is smart meter business,\nhas got two types of receivables.\n\nOne which is sitting in current receivables, which are of the nature of device supply and then\nreceived from device supply. The other is the nature of business caught through the contract that\nPage 7 of 21\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\nwe acquired from one of the customers of Iskraemeco. And some portion of those receivables\nsit under other non-current assets.\nAnd we have taken some simple steps in the earnings call also we mentioned to make sure that\nthis is not a recurring portion of receivables, but this is a part of the business that we have actually\nacquired. So going forward, we will make sure that before this year is over, we get rid of these\nreceivables with appropriate financing so that it's not in our books, because these pertain to\nalmost like the annuity type of payments, which are like home loan payments and similar to that.\nThere is no performance link to these particular receivables, which is sitting under other non-\ncurrent assets.\nNow, as of September, I think the total receivables is about — yes, of the total receivables, about\nINR687 crores pertains to business of smart meters, which includes also the other non-current\nassets portion.\nSo, we are quite confident that INR240 crores, approximately INR240 crores of such receivables\nwill anyway get discounted and it'll reduce the amount. There will be further billing based on\nour business plan. And we will endeavor to make sure that these do not cross collection periods\nof 90 days, etc.\nSo, there have been improvements. We are still working on further improvements to be done.\nAs far as the notes to accounts missing is concerned, we have taken note of this particular\nactivity. The reason, the cause why it happened is that Iskraemeco was earlier a customer and a\nsupplier and see in the one portion of our last year, FY '25.\nAnd in the second portion of the last year, it was a related party. So while this was captured in\nthe related party transaction notes in Iskraemeco, in one of our subsidiaries, since this flip\nhappened, somehow this probably got missed out in mentioning.\nHowever, the accounting has been done properly. In future, we will do, for a related party\ntransaction, we are going to use some software to make sure that the contra entries of notes to\naccounts are fully done. And so that we don't have this situation of any repeats. Because we\nhave, we do have a large number of subsidiaries. And so, we'll make sure that this does not re-\noccur. Next question.\n\nSiddhartha Bera: And sir, in terms of the order book, a smart meter, how big will be the existing customer now\nwithin that. And also, in Iskraemeco FY 25 statements, there was a INR45 crores sort of overdue\nor more than 1 year pending receivable. If you have some more color on why it is pending and\nby when do you expect to recover or is there any risk of provisions in that?\n\nJairam Sampath: Yes, so this INR45 crores and the reconciliation will get closed. This is not really material to the\nbusiness, actually.",

    "content" : "then also do our businesses. So, that's the stand we have taken and we'll be publishing this Q&A\nso that this can be in record too.\n\nSudheer Guntupalli: Fair enough. And my second question is, from a pure accounting standpoint, if I look at it, I\nthink a booking, when an acquisition is done during purchase price allocation, booking\nsomething as intangible is a much better way and much more conservative accounting approach\nthan a booking goodwill. Because obviously, intangible has a predetermined amortization\nschedule while goodwill is only tested for impairment on a periodic basis.\n\nNow, from that standpoint, I think you have taken a more conservative approach. And also, one\nof the points that the previous participant mentioned that there was a receivable which is aged\nfor more than a year. Again, if I understand it right, before Iskraemeco was acquired, this is\nactually a payable from our end. Is that understanding, correct? It was a payable from Kaynes’\nend to Iskraemeco before it was acquired. And this only reflects in terms of better payable\nmanagement.\n\nSo, my question to your team is, if you have done a good job in being conservative on accounting\nin some aspects and in better payable management, so why is your investor relations team not\nso proactive in terms of clearing out these misinterpretations or misunderstandings? Ideally, they\nshould have been much more proactive in terms of going to the market and clearing these\nmisperceptions by the market participants. So, why is your Investor Relations team not so...\n\nJairam Sampath: The point is well taken. And internally also, we were given very little time when we put out our\nfirst -- so, we have just covered some skeletal information on those six points which were\nconclusions in the report.\n\nSo, in future, we will probably take a day and then make sure that the detailed response is given,\nincluding those tables, etcetera, so that we can set the speculation at rest quickly. Your point is\nwell taken. We are also internally counseling our people internally to make sure that they take\nthese points more in a detailed fashion, seriously and more factually.\n\nPage 13 of 21\nPIKAYNES P\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limite\nDecember 08, 2025\nAnd then, where there is a rebuttal required, we should rebut. Where there is clarification\nrequired, we should clarify. And where there is an acceptance required and correction, we should\ndo that. Point well taken, sir. We will do that.\n\nSudheer Guntupalli: Fair enough, Jairam. Thanks, and all the best.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes on the line of Indrajit Agarwal with CLSA. Please go ahead.\n\nIndrajit Agarwal: Hi, sir. Thank you for this call. It clarifies a lot of things. Couple of questions. One is more a\nfactual question. In 1H FY '26, how much R&D we have spent and how much of that is expense\nand how much is capitalized?\n\nJairam Sampath: Which period you are pertaining to, sir?\n\nIndrajit Agarwal: 1H FY \"26. So, for the half year...\n\nJairam Sampath: First half FY 26, sir. We will have to pull out those statements. And we were only prepared for\nanswers to the FY 25 numbers. So, we will pull that out and give it to you, sir. It is not very\nmajorly different from our trend, actually. And there are a lot of ongoing ODM projects, etcetera,",

    "content" : "7 additions of PPE, CWIP, intangibles, intangible assets under development,\netcetera. After adjusting the capital advances payable to the capital goods and he's spent some\ntwo pages on this Exhibit 35, 36, etcetera.\nOur response is the purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statements amounting to 9.5 billion\nincludes 7.8 billion of PPE, CWIP, Capital WIP that is, intangibles after adjusting for capital\nadvances and payable of capital goods. INR1.7 billion of right of use assets, ROU assets, net of\nsubsidy. The purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement disclosing cash flow from\ninvesting activities. I hope this clarifies this particular question on cash flow.\nContingent liability is a net foreign exposure price. Contingent liability is increased to 5.2\nbillion, 18% of net worth and from FY 24 of 2.7 billion, 11% of net worth, is fairly due to\nPage 6 of 21\nTECHNOLOGY Kaynes Technology India Limited\nDecember 08, 2025\n\nincrease in bank corporate is what the report from Kotak Securities said. The key increases relate\nto -- from our point of view and based on our facts, the key increases relate to 1.9 billion of\nperformance bank guarantees issued to Iskraemeco projects.\nThen 1.3 billion of corporate guarantees issued to subsidiary companies, Kaynes Electronics\nManufacturing Private Limited, INR1.2 billion and Iskraemeco 0.1 billion. These guarantees are\nnecessitated by funding requirements of the subsidiaries for ongoing businesses. So, these are\nour major clarifications to some of those exhibits and a large report that was made.\nSo, some total of this is that factually speaking, there is only one small error of not mentioning\nin the notes to accounts of a disclosure of a related party transaction, which you've taken note of\nand we'll make sure that in future, such misses don't happen. Otherwise, there are absolutely no\ninconsistencies, ambiguities, whether intended or actual. And most of the conclusions and\nimplications made actually are not valid.\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: You can ask the questions.\n\nJairam Sampath: If you have any clarifications further, you can ask. We'll be publishing this in the stock exchange\nalso, for those of you who may not have noted down fully. After some time, before the end of\nthe day, we will publish this entire thing in the stock exchange.\n\nModerator: Should I go ahead and ask for questions, speakers?\n\nRamesh Kunhikannan: Yes.\n\nModerator: All right. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question\ncomes to the line of Siddhartha Bera with Nomura. Please go ahead.\n\nSiddhartha Bera: Yes. Hi, sir. Thanks for the opportunity and thanks for clarifying many of these queries. First\n\nquestion is basically, initially Ramesh sir highlighted that we are in the process of taking more\nsteps to address and see that some of these issues don't get reported in or don't recur in the future.\nSo if you can just highlight a few of these things, what are we planning to do to see that some of\nthese things don't recur in the future?\nSecond thing to Jairam sir, will be on the receivable side. If you can sort of break up the entire\nreceivable of close to 11 billion plus 3 billion of older receivable of 14 billion customer wise\nand how does the sort of smart meter order book change in terms of customers going ahead?
