    "content" : "The Foods portfolio performed broadly in line with the stated expectations, as we had talked\nabout in the last call, that we will take a pause on our growth as we rectify some of the portfolio\nwhich is not delivering high on profitability. So, Saffola Oats continued to gain market share\nand consolidate market leadership. As we had conveyed earlier, with the portfolio rapidly scaling\nup to ARR of INR 1,000 crore, our focus has been on stabilization and strengthening profitability\ntowards building a sustainable, profitable growth engine. We remain very bullish on value-added\nfoods and nutra opportunity in India, and our strategy to invest in fewer, bigger, better plays in\nterms of our portfolio approach. That being said, we are confident of resuming the accelerated\ngrowth trajectory in our organic food business over the next two quarters.\nPage 3 of 16\nRegd.

CIN: L15140MH1988PLC049208.\nEmail: investor@marico.com\nMarico Information classification: Official\nmarico\nmake a differance Marico Limited\nJanuary 27, 2026\nWe also announced the strategic investment in one of India's leading premium gourmet snacking\nbrands, 4700BC. This is renowned for its popcorn and also offers a range of innovative snack\nofferings such as popped chips, makhana, crunchy corn, and a recently launched nachos with\navocado oil. We would like to share our perspective on this investment. When you look at our\nFoods portfolio today, among Saffola, which stands for healthy foods, playing in the mass-stage\nsegment, True Elements, which stands for the clean label, premium breakfast cereals, nuts and\nseeds, and snacking segment, and Plix, which does nutraceuticals, there was a gap in our\nportfolio of our premium gourmet snack, which is better for you and can deliver a mix of\nofferings for all occasions. I am particularly excited about how the better-for-you gourmet\nsnacking brands are becoming a choice for the consumer, who want taste and differentiated\nflavors as a part of their routine. We believe 4700BC is an underleveraged and an underinvested\nbrand that can, if afforded the required investment and our overall capabilities, including cost,\nchannel, GTM, and with a strong new product pipeline ahead, it will continue to push boundaries\nin the premium gourmet snacking arena. Together, we will tap the opportunity to leverage our\nexisting scale in foods and drive synergies and broaden the brand's presence across channels. It\nis clocking at about INR 140 crores ARR in the last three months. We see tremendous potential\nfor the brand to scale its ARR to 3x in the next three years.\nIn Premium Personal Care, the portfolio comprising Serums, Male Grooming, and Skincare grew\nin double digits and is expected to exit the year at an ARR of INR 350+ crores. In addition, the\nDigital-First portfolio is expected to exit FY \"26 with an ARR of INR +1,000 crores. We are on\ntrack to reach 2.5x of FY '24 ARR next year, and we are making concerted efforts to move to\ndouble-digit EBITDA margin in the Digital-First portfolio by end of FY 27.\nMoving on, the international business continued to deliver robust and broad-based growth.\nBangladesh led from the front, supported by a steady core business and a scale-up of new\nfranchises like shampoos. Vietnam and South Africa bounced back to deliver double-digit\nconstant currency growth, driven by targeted initiatives. MENA continued to deliver strong",

    "content" : "will wait, , by a certain time, where we get a visibility of what will be the likely input cost for\nthe large part of the year. When it happens, we will take one shot, one price, we will take. And\nas [ said, that the two differences are that we obviously have a far more thinner pipeline and a\nfar better position in terms of our ability to handle this. Yes, in the past we have struggled, but\nthis time we are confident that there will be no such issues as far as volume growth is concerned.\nAnd in any case, the absolute pricing was so high this time, that had impacted volume growth.\n\nHarit Kapoor: Great to hear.\n\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Percy from IIFL. Please go ahead.\n\nPercy: Hi, Saugata. My question is also on the copra pricing only. So, supposing if this price remains\nwhere it is, which is like a 20% down, and you are saying that you are comfortable with this kind\nof a premium to the other players, in that kind of a situation, what kind of margin expansion can\nwe expect on a overall consol basis for the company because of the pricing benefit on the copra?\n\nPawan Agrawal: So, we didn't say that we will not take any pricing action. We just want to get a firm handle of\nwhat the copra trajectory could be. If it were to remain 20% lower, then still we might take\ncorrection, but over a period of time, which we may not be doing immediately. And therefore,\nfrom a margin standpoint, I just mentioned, I mean, very difficult to give you margin percentage\nguidance, very confident of delivering mid-teens growth. But we will definitely strive for, as |\nsaid earlier, that 150 to 200 basis points margin expansion we should try and improve.\n\nPercy: Okay, mid-teens growth in rupee terms on EBITDA.\n\nPawan Agrawal: Operating profit, yes.\n\nSaugata Gupta: Yes, that should be our base case.\n\nPercy: Secondly, just wanted to understand on Saffola foods, this quarter growth is only 5%. What is\nthe reason for that?\n\nSaugata Gupta: As I told you that, two things: One, we are ensuring profitability, so we take, a lot of businesses\nwhich we believe is, two things. One, we had these things like mayo, peanut butter and all that\n\nPage 11 of 16\nRegd. Off: 7th Floor, Grande Palladium, 175, CST Road, Kalina, Santa Cruz (East), Mumbai — 400098. CIN: L15140MH1988PLC049208.\nEmail: investor@marico.com\nMarico Information classification: Official\nmake a differance Marico Limited\nJanuary 27, 2026\nwe have rationalized, which was there perhaps in the base. Some of the SKUs which, we have\nreduced complexity, rationalized some of the SKUs. And thirdly, in certain SKUs into\ncustomer/channel, which are not so profitable, we have rationalized that also. Because I believe\nin food, you have to continuously, after every two, three years, get into one step jump into\nprofitability.\n\nPercy: So, would I be right in assuming that if you have sort of rationalized the SKUs itself, this burden\nwill be there for another three quarters before it anniversarizes and your growth would probably\nin single digit?\n\nSaugata Gupta: No, one to two quarters. We started this 1.5 quarters ago, so within over the next 2 quarters, we\nwill start seeing growth, good growth.",

    "content" : "and the other brand is called Proper, which is a UK-based brand. And I am sure\nwe will follow their trajectories and get inspired from these brands. And there is another big\ntrend in the U.S., there is a brand called SkinnyPop, which is growing, again, which is a popcorn\nand better-for-you brand. Now, that will give you an idea of what is possible in terms of the\nportfolio. Now, if I look at the overall, broad sense of the portfolio of 4700BC, PVR Cinemas is\nvery low. It is just about double digits. There is a big institutional business and exports, but they\nare very, very good because, as you know, these institutional business creates very good\nsampling opportunities. At the same time, it also ensures that there is no marketing cost of doing\ns0. So, 4700BC is available in the following airlines. It is available in all business class lounges\nof Etihad. It is available in Qatar, Cathay Pacific, in first and business class of Air India. Most\n\nPage 5 of 16\nRegd.

CIN: L15140MH1988PLC049208.\nEmail: investor@marico.com\nMarico Information classification: Official\nrﬂki ‘E\"]“E\"S Marico Limited\nJanuary 27, 2026\nrecently in some of the European routes of IndiGo, which goes to Amsterdam, Manchester, and\njust recently, last week to Athens. It is available in Vande Bharat and in one or two hotels. And\nthat business, plus we have a very good business that just started in the Middle East. We believe\nthere is significant opportunity now with Marico’s access to the e-commerce and other channels.\nSo, that is around 20% to 25%. The rest is all online, very little retail. So, we believe that modern\ntrade, for example where Marico can give access, and the top-end food is the best route to grow.\nIf you look at the trajectory of some of the brands, let's take iD, Veeba, Epigamia, they now have\nsignificant part of their business in retail, and that business is missing. in terms of investments,\nwe are happy to do, and at the same time, you must realize today we already have some digital\nbrands like True Elements. There will be huge opportunities in shared costs and other things\nwhen they come into the Marico fold. So, therefore, this will all happen, there will be no\nincremental investment to expand into GT. So, that takes care, and last year it made about INR\n12 crores loss. This plus True Elements together can now have an accelerated path to breaking\neven with all the tapping of the synergies. There is a strong innovation pipeline with this brand,\nand we will unfold.\nAnd if you really look at it, Indians, while they love healthy products, they don't compromise on\ntaste. Perhaps indulgence gourmet is going to grow. As people’s habits in terms of binge-\nwatching OTT and other things like Friday night in, those things which I have seen, which you\nsee in developed markets, this progress, the tailwinds towards adoption of this brand is very\nhigh. And therefore, this was a missing link in our entire foods portfolio. If you look at it, Saffola\nplays in mass-stage health, True Elements in clean, premium seeds and breakfast and snacking.\nSo, this was a gap out there, and it is a perfect gap. And I believe, we also believe we love the",

    "content" : "where packaged food penetration in India is low, the fact that the entire packaged food is at 5%,\nthat definitely encourages conversion from unbranded to branded, unpackaged to packaged.\nPackaged food is hygienic, packaged food is aspirational.\n\nSimilarly, in some of the Personal Care categories, mass categories, which have become 5%,\nthere will be a medium to long-term movement towards aspirational brands, because of the\naffordability factor, which has now set in with this significant reduction in GST, especially\nPersonal Care categories, which have moved from 18% to 5%, which means a significant\nreduction and driving affordability because as the country's GDP improves, as the per capita\nincome improves, people want aspirational brands.\n\nIt is the outlay which sometimes is a restriction. And therefore, structurally, in the medium term,\nGST is transformative. It will definitely give added growth to all the brands, especially in\ncategories which have seen a significant GST cut.\n\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take our last question from the line of Sheela Rathi from\nMorgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nSheela Rathi: My question is with respect to the 4700BC acquisition. The first part of the question is, now that,\nSaugata, you talked about how different the distribution for this brand has been, where they are\ncatering to institutions, airlines, and malls, is there a need for us to learn or unlearn with respect\nto the distribution strategy, or we will just focus on what we are strong at, which is the retail\ndistribution? And the second part to this question is, what is the real competition in this category\nat this point in time? I am sure the TAM is still small, but who are the real competitors here?\n\nPage 15 of 16\nRegd. Off: 7th Floor, Grande Palladium, 175, CST Road, Kalina, Santa Cruz (East), Mumbai — 400098. CIN: L15140MH1988PLC049208.\nEmail: investor@marico.com\nMarico Information classification: Official\nmarico\nmake a differance Marico Limited\nJanuary 27, 2026\n\nSaugata Gupta: Let me first address the second question. , see, you have to see TAM as snacking. A consumer\ncan take a samosa, a consumer can have a popcorn, soup, noodles, and they can have ragi chips.\nSo, the entire thing that you have to look at, you are playing in a slightly more indulgent but\nbetter-for-you gourmet portion of snacking, and the market is enormous. So, it doesn't have\npopcorn to popcorn, unless you are going only for a movie. And as I said that part of the business\nis extremely low. There is no need to unlearn. This brand has significant legs, and I said that for\nsampling people to experience the product, what they are doing in institutional selling will\ncontinue. The brand is still 60%-70% retail. It is currently mostly e-com. So, therefore, the first\nthing is obviously to grow that in things like modern trade, premium food outlets using the\nMarico GTM. And in fact, this will help us tomorrow, for example, looking at True Elements\nfor institutional sales. If a person can have popcorn on a flight, why can't they have some mixed\nnuts on a flight from True Elements? So, therefore, actually it opens up multiple synergies. It\nopens up multiple vectors of growth. At the same time, as I said, with True Elements, this brand\nand others, there are a lot of synergies at the back end and cost. Today, each brand has their own",

    "content" : "as you see, recent trends about also a double-digit volume growth is also very much possible.\nAnd see, it is a combination of different factors. the resource allocation is working. We have\nconverted a lot of monies which was locked into BTL, spends in the 10-20 packs of Shanti Amla\ninto ATL. We believe, the job of a market leader is to drive equity and not be satisfied if the\ncompetitor doesn't spend with a SOV, because ultimately we have significantly invested in SOV.\nIf you look at the reach and the weighted distribution of each of the brands due to SETU has\nincreased sufficiently, and far more sharper positioning and a portfolio approach across states.\nYou are absolutely right about the mix, because the moment the mix of VAHO increases, that\nwill be a margin kind of a tailwind. And I will want Pawan to answer the expectation on the\nmargins.\n\nPawan Agrawal: Mihir, the first thing that you said is, of course, value-added hair oil has better margins, and that\nexactly is the reason as to why we could still deliver reasonably resilient profit growth this year,\ndespite significant copra inflation, because the mix has helped. Now, as far as next year is\nconcerned, again, giving a guidance with respect to what kind of a percentage margin we can\ndeliver is difficult, but at least we are very confident of delivering at least mid-teen growth. We\ncould try for more, and at least we would strive for improving the operating margin by about\n150-200 basis points.\n\nMihir Shah: That is very clear. Thanks for that. Second, on the copra-led price cuts, given that this time\naround price increases were relatively very sharp, , there is an expectation that the price cuts also\nprobably will be very sharp. So, wanted to get a sense on how should one think about the pricing\nin Parachute as you go down the quarter, given copra is already down 30%. Maybe in a month\nor two, you had earlier highlighted that price cuts can probably start in Feb or March. I wanted\nto get a sense of that, and how many times do you think that one will have to take price cuts to\nensure the trade channel remains healthy in terms of stocking? So, that is the second question.\n\nPawan Agrawal: So, Mihir, we haven't taken any pricing action so far, and there are two, three reasons for that.\nFirstly, we had not taken price increase in line with the increase in copra prices. Copra prices\n\nPage 9 of 16\nRegd. Off: 7th Floor, Grande Palladium, 175, CST Road, Kalina, Santa Cruz (East), Mumbai — 400098.

So, now that the copra\nprices have corrected by 25%-30%, we are not taking any immediate correction from a premium\nstandpoint, as in premium to loose oil, we are still comfortable, and therefore, we need not be\ngetting into pricing action immediately. Secondly, we are still awaiting to get a firm handle on\nhow the copra price trajectory will move, which we will get by March-April, and then take\ncorrection in one go, rather than taking in multiple steps, because if you take pricing correction\nin multiple steps, it disturbs the trade rhythm. So, that is how we are looking at it. However, we",

    "content" : "And as I said, two things. One is that we are comfortable with our price premium as we are\ntoday. Number two is that we don't need to take an aggressive price down because, see, you must\nalso realize that we are, the brand equity keeps on growing stronger. Usually after such a long,\nI mean, an inflationary cycle, weaker brands, they really become weak. Number three, which is\nalso gives us hope that at least one of our competitors is being extremely rational on pricing,\nbecause we also faced, as you know, irrational pricing from two competitors in the past, and\nnow at least one of them is following a rational pricing model, which I believe is good, because\nat the end of the day, there is no point selling at negative gross margin. That spoils the market\nlong term and creates equity. So, a combination of all that. And as I said that today we are sitting\non 33% of this quarter gone, and we are sitting pretty comfortably. And as I said that, also the\nthird thing that will help us is there is about 3% loss which we were having on ml-age, that gets\nanniversarized from Quarter 1 next year. So, a combination of that, we are fairly certain.\nObviously, I know because of the past, there could be certain kinds of issues which we are far,\nfar in a better shape to cope with. And , as I said, to give positive growth, and really look at it\nthis way, that, with a 60% price hike in transaction terms, we have still given growth. Now, that\nitself, I am yet to see any brand in the world which has done that. So, we are far more confident,\nand therefore, there is no need to take, as I said, we will not take multiple price hikes. We will\ntake one single price hike, which will ensure a far more smoother transition. And some of it\nobviously will go towards margin expansion.\n\nNihal Mahesh Jham: Just, just one quick follow-up on the foods business. You did mention that the CAGR growth\nthat you are giving includes 4700BC. Now, just to get a sense that it may be difficult for us to\nget a sense of how acquisitions will play out over the next three years. But for this current foods\nportfolio, what is the bare minimum organic growth that you will be targeting?\n\nPage 13 of 16\nRegd.

CIN: L15140MH1988PLC049208.\nEmail: investor@marico.com\nMarico Information classification: Official\nmake a differance Marico Limited\nJanuary 27, 2026\n\nSaugata Gupta: We have always said we will deliver double-digit growth, organic growth, and we have been\ndelivering double-digit organic growth. This is an aberration, and we have to get it sorted within\nthe next 1 or 2 quarters, we are confident of.\n\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Prakash Kapadia from Kapadia Financial Services.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nPrakash Kapadia: Just wanted to get a sense on the cold-pressed market. Any thoughts? Are we late in the segment\nbecause it is already a competitive market, or the TAM is very large, and we see structural\nopportunities with increasing health awareness? So, what is your thought on that? And typically,\nit is more for the Q-com, e-com customer only, the general trade would be lower, is what [ would\nguess.\n\nAnd secondly, Saugata, on the GST cuts, how do we see volume growth picking up?",

We will not take multiple price cuts. The big change that has happened is that we work with\nfar, far thinner pipelines because of our supply chain efficiencies and our Al-based forecasting\nmodels. So, therefore, we are compared to, say, five years ago and all that, that the changeover,\nwhich used to take 8 weeks to 12 weeks, especially in rural, this is going to be much faster\nbecause of what we are doing now.\n\nMihir Shah: That is very clear.\n\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Harit Kapoor from Investec. Please go ahead.\n\nHarit Kapoor: There is two questions. First is on foods. The growth rates, you had already mentioned in the\nlast quarter that you will relook at the profitability, just adjust it and then see an acceleration in\ngrowth. You have spoken about 25% CAGR as well in your presentation. Just wanted to know,\nwhat is the timeline that we can expect that you see a recovery in the growth rate starting to kind\nof pick up again on the food side? And the second question is on Bangladesh. Again, phenomenal\nperformance in that market, as you have continued to do extremely well, but there continue to\nbe some macroeconomic uncertainties. So, just wanted your thought, the last time something\nlike this happened, you kind of went through relatively unscathed. Just wanted to get your sense\non how do you see the position on ground? So, these are the two questions.\n\nSaugata Gupta: As far as food is concerned, as far as the organic part of the food is concerned, we will get back\ninto growth in the coming two quarters. When we talk about food, 20%-25% growth, it is a\ncombination of organic, inorganic, and we are absolutely certain we will start getting back into\n25% growth of food business. Now, coming to Bangladesh, yes, , we are waiting, we are closely\nmonitoring the situation. So far, we have been extremely resilient. Even in Quarter 2, when the\nissues were quite grim in terms of the, it was in August that this thing happened. That quarter,\nwe grew by 8%. So, we have taken steps out there, and we don't see any reason to be extremely\nconcerned at this moment in time in terms of delivering business.\n\nPage 10 of 16\nRegd.

The Parachute process that you have mentioned is\nbasically saying that there was a reduction in the RPIs that you were making because you took\na much lower price increase than you did, and you wait for those RPIs to maybe slightly\nnormalize a little bit, and then you take the one shot price tag. That is right?\n\nSaugata Gupta: Yes, that is right. That is right. See, if you look at it, copra actually moved more than 100%. We\ntook a 60% price hike.

So, it is fine.\n\nPercy: That's all from me.\n\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Nihal Mahesh Jham from HSBC. Please go ahead.\n\nNihal Mahesh Jham: Saugata, congratulations on the good performance. Just, continuing on the foods bit of it, as you\nhighlighted, is it mainly a case of moderation in the portfolio on the SKU basis? Or are we also,\nsay, optimizing some of the advertising spends in, say, a lot of these online first brands? And\nwhereas the confidence coming, if I leave apart the inorganic element, that you mentioned about\n4700BC sort of being consolidated, that the growth is going to recover in two quarters. So, what\nis driving that confidence?\n\nSaugata Gupta: Two things. One, as I said, so we have stopped, rationalized, some of the products, like we had\nsome flavors, some things like, what I call mayo, peanut butter and some of the stuff we had\nlaunched. So, that anniversarization is going to happen. Secondly, obviously, all the investments\nwill go focused back into driving penetration of our core. So, we have now rationalized and that\nshould drive some of the growth back. Now, as I said, as long as, we expect the growth go, to\ngo back into double digits. And, obviously, this doesn't include any innovation. Any innovation\nwhich we do organically from our base portfolio also adds to that. So, our first step is over the\nnext two quarters to get into double digits, which we are pretty confident about. And then, the\noverall foods growth will continue because of whatever organic plus inorganic into the 20%-\n25%+.\n\nPage 12 of 16\nRegd.

We are obviously sitting on our raw material inventory, so\nthat somewhere limits immediate pricing action.

    "content" : "founders who have a mindset of build to last rather than build to sell. And we are extremely\nconfident about scaling this brand up, and it is a brand we all love. The products are very nice,\nand we are very, very optimistic about growing this brand.\n\nPawan Agrawal: Just to add on the profitability, Abneesh, the brand has gross contribution and CM2, which is\nahead of Marico's food business at this point in time. And it is a premium brand, which has\nsignificant pricing power. So, therefore, of course, we can also expect that the margins can go\neven higher in the future. And there are significant synergies in the back-end cost and GTM,\nwhich will be leveraged in the near term and unlock synergies. So, overall, from a profitability\ncontext, of course, we will be investing at this point in time, but whether the brand has path to\nprofitability to reach, let's say, double-digit margin over a period of time, we are fairly confident\nit can really go there.\n\nAbneesh Roy: One or two follow-ups there. So one is, Saugata, you always mention Marico, and you obviously\nwant to take bigger bets. Now, this is around 1% of your revenue. So, does it fit that? Not\neverything needs to fit. So, that was one question. Second is, your example of the Lesser Evil\nbrand, for example. Those need a different mindset, and you did say the founders, etc. So, I\n\nPage 6 of 16\nRegd.

Because this is completely new white space you have\n\nopened up. Till now, Saffola or the other brands have been mostly in the health space. This opens\n\nup the impulse and the gourmet. Obviously, this is too small. So, I wanted to understand, does\n\nthis open up much bigger opportunity on your own or, say, even M&A-wise, in the longer term?\n\nSaugata Gupta: So, our digital business, entire philosophy is think big, start small, scale up fast or drop fast.\nAnd therefore, it is a string of pearls strategy to do something big. We are another, maybe two\nyears from now, we have a INR 2,500 crore+ digital business, which is bigger than some of the\nmultinationals companies who have stayed in India for 20-25 years. So, it is big. The digital\nbusiness and the entire diversification agenda has been big. There are steps to that bigness rather\nthan doing one thing. We obviously have done big things. our VAHO turnaround is a big thing.\nThere are opportunities in organically growing big things. Digital Plix, we took it at INR 150\ncrore. It should be hitting INR 1,000 crore. Again, we have done this. The question is, I don't\nbelieve in buying something big and paying 6x for that. That is something which we don't want\nto do. We are far more prudent. We want the founders to have the skin in the game, grow with\nus, and we learn the business from them. So, the question is, we have started small, but there is",

    "content" : "Is there a\ntailwind for larger players like us where growth can be higher and we can gain market share?\n\nSaugata Gupta: Coming to cold-pressed oils, it started off as a niche kind, but it is rapidly catching up. In fact,\nit is a big trend today in the Western markets. And as you know, India picks up a lot of trends\nfrom U.K. and the U.S., the developed markets, in terms of food habits at the premium end. Yes,\nit is currently a far more skew in e-com, but we believe we are now seeing this in modern trade,\nand it will very soon be a critical mass. We are not late to the party at all. I would call ourselves\na fast follower with a brand which has significant equity, and we have now a broad participation\nstrategy. The good thing is it makes significant higher margins than some of the entry-level\nSaffola, which will also help in the profitability of Saffola, and we will also invest. And\nsometimes what happens in a category with low penetration, if you have two, three serious\nplayers investing behind the category, the category grows. And this is exactly the position where\ncold-pressed oil is. And it is today a drop in the ocean in the large edible oil space. But as you\nknow, you had all the premium hair oils, premium edible oils, which grew. For example, how\nwe grew Saffola, how the premium part grew or some of the other spaces grew. cold pressed oil\nalso will have a critical mass very soon. modern trade and premium GT will see a significant\npresence of cold-pressed oil in the couple of years.\n\nPrakash Kapadia: And typically, consumers are ready to pay 2x price of edible oil. Is that the broader price you\nwant to?\n\nSaugata Gupta: See, I will tell you how it works. Today, at the premium end, while people are wanting to pay\nfor healthy oil, they are also using less oil. Also, if you look at people eating out, people ordering\nin through food apps, people traveling abroad, actual cooking oil consumption at the premium\nend, in terms of total volume actually has gone down a bit. So, I don't think the outlay is that\nsignificant enough for the top end. So, that delta for health is absolutely acceptable because they\n\nPage 14 of 16\nRegd.

Because\nsome of these smaller players could get marginalized. How do we see that shaping up?\n\nSaugata Gupta: 1 didn't get your question. This is for which category you are talking about?\n\nPrakash Kapadia: No, in general, volume growth in the midterm, given that GST cut has happened, which was not\nexpected last quarter. From here on, is there room for higher growth and smaller players could\nlose market share structurally? Is that an opportunity?\n\nSaugata Gupta: Absolutely.

    "content" : "no reason to not develop and make it big together rather than buying something big and then not\ngrowing it.\n\nPawan Agrawal: And just for the context, Abneesh, our diversified portfolio just a few years ago, was just about\n11%-12% of India business, and we have taken a target of reaching about 25%. We have already\nreached about 22%. So, it is not about the size of the business when you acquire. It is all about\nthe potential that we assess it can become. For example, Saugata talked about Plix. Similarly,\nwe are very hopeful that all these businesses will grow bigger over a period of time.\n\nSaugata Gupta: And to answer your second question, Abneesh, you are absolutely right. I believe that with True\nElements plus Saffola, we found that snacking, if I really want to grow snacking, it could become\nrestrictive, and therefore we opened up. Having said that, we will continue to play in the\npremium end, which is organized trade plus maybe metro food outlets. I don't think we have a\nright to win today in a paan plus or doing a INR 5, INR 10 product right now. We don't have the\nGTM, neither the capability. But it at least opens up as India progresses and the premium set\nopens up, I believe there is enough critical mass. And you are right, , this significantly improves\nthe TAM expansion for our food business.\n\nAbneesh Roy: My second and last question is on hair oil. So, overall excitement in the hair oil is coming back\nin the minds of investors. We have seen the small hair oil company with the new CEO doing\nwell. They have also called out hair oil as a category, is seeing a somewhat of a revival. You\nhave done exceedingly well past few quarters in VAHO. So, my question is, as a category in\nhair oil, how do you see next one year? Last few quarters has been good for VAHO. And second,\n\nPage 7 of 16\nRegd.

As a company, would you see that challenge that\nsuddenly the sales growth for the company in India business becomes a challenge at some stage?\nWhat will be your take on that?\n\nSaugata Gupta: See, there are two things. One is, this time the absolute inflation was very high, which actually\nimpacted volume growth, and we had done some of the ml-age reduction, which anniversarizes\nin the first quarter next year. Secondly, you will be surprised because we were pleasantly\nsurprised with the price elasticity of the brand. And therefore, when the deflation happens, some\ndeflation has already happened, we will be far better prepared, including a far, far thinner\npipeline to manage it. As far as hair oil VAHO growth is concerned, if you look at the VAHO\ngrowth, the two-year CAGR ex of Shanti is 14%, the quarterly Y-o-Y growth is very high teens.\nSo, we are at a double digit two-year CAGR and it is great turnaround.",

    "content" : "I believe that there is\nenough opportunity, and what is also helping is SETU, because if I look at the biggest impact\nso far in the states where we have expanded distribution, improved the quality of rural\ndistribution, converted a lot of indirect to direct, has been the growth of the second and the third\nbrand, because that is where range selling happens. And SETU, we are today, if you ask me, we\nhave done ~30%. There is still 70% to go, and it is a 3-5-year project. I mean, three years\nobviously was initially designed, but I am sure if we can get it, it is going to continue for the\nnext three to five years. So, we are extremely confident about this. And one more interesting\nthing we are doing is that at one point in time, the volume value share gap in hair oils was 10%.\nIt has now gone down to 5%. So, focus on abandoning the, I won't call it abandoning, but holding\nfort in the bottom of pyramid and INR 10-20 price points, not doing anything irrational, but\nfocusing on the packs like Jasmine, Aloe, Hair & Care, and some of the other brands, is actually\nhelping, and we will continue to focus on value share. And as you know, these brands are actually\nhigh margin. So, they are helping in the mix. They are helping in the overall gross margin\nimprovement over the next couple of years.\n\nAbneesh Roy: That's all from me.\n\nSaugata Gupta: And sorry, just to add, just to reassure everyone, this is a category which is very close to India.\nNot only that, it is a category that is significant, even the Middle East, including Middle Eastern\ncountries, Egypt. I mean, this is a category that continues to grow, and we have great faith in\nthis category, and we have ensured that we continue to invest behind this habit. And this habit\nis going to stay. That is something which we have proven in the last 20 years, contrary to some\npeople thinking this category will die down.\n\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Shah from Nomura. Please go ahead.\n\nPage 8 of 16\nRegd. Off: 7th Floor, Grande Palladium, 175, CST Road, Kalina, Santa Cruz (East), Mumbai — 400098. CIN: L15140MH1988PLC049208.\nEmail: investor@marico.com\nMarico Information classification: Official\nrﬂki ‘E\"]“E\"S Marico Limited\nJanuary 27, 2026\n\nMihir Shah: So, just continuing on VAHO, except for SETU, the kind of growth that we are seeing is really\nsharp, and apparently the other players are also seeing sharper growth. But I don't see them\nmarrying together because each of these subcategories have a different market. They are more\ningredient-based hair oils, which are preferred. So, what is really driving this growth? What is a\nsustainable number for VAHO that we can think about over the near term, maybe the next two\nto four quarters? So, that is part A. Part B is, given VAHO has the highest margin in the core\nbusiness, higher than Parachute and Saffola, and as copra headwinds start to wane and those\nmargins will start improving, higher growth from VAHO can add to that margin expansion. So,\nhow should one think about that play as well? So that is my first question.\n\nSaugata Gupta: Coming to, , we are extremely confident of delivering double-digit value growth in VAHO. And",

    "content" : "higher MSPs, and a healthy crop sowing season. We believe these factors provide a constructive\nbackdrop for demand improvement across both urban and rural markets in the coming quarters.\nMoving on to our quarterly performance, the India business demonstrated a sequential\nimprovement in volume growth despite an elevated pricing environment, which started tapering\noff towards the end of the quarter. Revenue momentum remained strong, aided by calibrated\npricing actions across core portfolios over the last 12 months in response to the rise in input\ncosts. Our franchises have continued to record strong offtakes, with more than 95% of the\nbusiness gaining or sustaining market share and about 80% gaining or sustaining penetration on\na MAT basis. Among channels, while e-commerce and quick commerce were leading growth\ndrivers, we saw a clear improvement in traditional trade, marking the outcome of consistent\ninvestments and targeted actions over the last 2 years. Project SETU has continued to strengthen\nour distribution fundamentals, execution capabilities, and the coverage expansion remains firmly\non track, led by deeper presence in upgraded towns and pan-India rural scale-up. We will now\ncommence our initiatives on targeted expansion in urban channels, such as chemist, cosmetic,\nand specialty food outlets. These actions are enhancing our direct reach, improving product\nPage 2 of 16\nRegd. Off: 7th Floor, Grande Palladium, 175, CST Road, Kalina, Santa Cruz (East), Mumbai — 400098.

With correction having set in\nand copra prices down by around 25% to 30% from peak levels, the brand will be passing on the\nbenefit to the consumer in the coming months, as and when we believe it is the right time to do\nit. While we expect near-term performance to remain stable, easing absolute consumer prices\nwill support a gradual recovery in volume growth over the course of the next year.\nValue-added hair oils delivered another strong quarter with accelerated market share gains. Our\nvalue share on MAT basis stands at an all-time high of nearly 30%, showing considerable\nprogress towards premiumization of the mix and bridging the gap between volume and value\nshare, along with our intended lines and long-term aspirations. We remain confident of\nsustaining a double-digit growth trajectory in the near-to-medium term, supported by sharp\nstrategic focus on the mid and premium segments, consistent innovation across channels,\nenhanced direct reach through Project SETU, and structural tailwinds from the recent GST rate\nrationalization, which has driven affordability.\nSaffola Edible Oil had a soft quarter in a relatively elevated pricing environment, with revenue\ngrowth moderating as prior pricing actions largely anniversarized in this quarter. Like in the\nprevious quarter, we have sacrificed volumes which are below our threshold margins across\ncertain packs and channels. Going forward, the brand will continue to sharpen its\npremiumization agenda, led by Saffola Gold and Total variants, and the recently introduced Cold\nPressed Oils, which is doing quite well. Backed by strong equity and focused consumer\nactivations, we expect Saffola to chart an improving volume growth trajectory in the coming\nquarters.",

    "content" : "performance in key franchises across both the Gulf region and Egypt. The NCD business also\ndelivered accelerated growth. Overall, the international business is now exhibiting a virtuous\ngrowth flywheel, and we expect this momentum to sustain across markets over the medium term.\nTo sum up, we delivered a strong and resilient performance in Q3, with both the India and\ninternational businesses progressing well in a steady operating environment. We will remain\nsharply focused on execution, strengthening our franchises and driving sustainable volume-led\ngrowth. In India, we expect to drive improved trajectory in the core portfolio while driving the\nprofitable scale-up of foods and digital-first businesses. We aim to sustain the volume growth\nmomentum even as pricing growth is likely to moderate over the course of the next few quarters.\nWith input cost easing and margin pressure subsiding, we expect progressive improvement in\noperating profit growth rates over the coming quarters.\nPage 4 of 16\nRegd.

CIN: L15140MH1988PLC049208.\nEmail: investor@marico.com\nMarico Information classification: Official\nrﬂki ‘E\"]“E\"S Marico Limited\nJanuary 27, 2026\nAs we look ahead, we are moving from stability to purposeful acceleration, leveraging a resilient\noperating model and a disciplined cost architecture. Our priorities are clear: sharp portfolio\nchoices, enabling faster decision-making and driving agile execution. Importantly, our agility\nhas enabled us to take targeted initiatives and successfully turn around portfolios within just a\nfew quarters. This is exhibited by the turnaround of VAHO in India and more recently, the quick\nrecovery in Vietnam and South Africa businesses. What gives us confidence as we move forward\nis that this acceleration is grounded in strong fundamentals and a high degree of accountability\nin the senior management. This balance of resilience and execution discipline, coupled with the\ntremendous leadership depth which we have developed over the past few years, has well-\npositioned us to sustain momentum and further accelerate the growth flywheel we have built.\nWith that, I conclude my remarks. Thank you. And we can now take some questions.\n\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question\ncomes from the line of Abneesh Roy from Nuvama. Please go ahead.\n\nAbneesh Roy: My first question is on the new acquisition. So, my questions here are, if you want to take it 3x\nin three years, if you could talk about what all are needed apart from the brand support. So, in\nterms of distribution, for example, where is the company now? For example, INR 140 crore\nARR, how much is coming from which kind of distribution channel? And where do you see the\ndelta? Second is from a pricing, obviously, this is gourmet, so it is premium. Would you plan to\nhave some kind of a offering, which also appeals to the smaller box GT? I do understand the\nlarger box GT will have an audience, but the small box GT, is there a pricing or positioning\nwhich is possible? And if you could also talk about profitability. I do understand initially\ninvestment will be needed, and it is unfair to look at first-year profitability for a brand which\nanyway may not be making profit. But from a three-year perspective, what will be the\nexpectation on the profitability?\n\nSaugata Gupta: First of all, I would urge you to look at two interesting brands globally, which started off with\npopcorn and have diversified and become reasonably blockbuster brands. One is called Lesser\nEvil in the U.S.",
